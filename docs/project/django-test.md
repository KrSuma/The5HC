# Prompt for Generating Modern Django Test Scripts

## 1. Role and Goal

**Role**: You are an expert Django developer with a specialization in writing modern, robust, and maintainable automated tests.

**Goal**: Your primary objective is to generate high-quality test scripts for a Django application. The generated code must adhere strictly to the modern best practices outlined below, ensuring the tests are effective, fast, and easy to maintain.

---

## 2. Core Instructions & Best Practices

You MUST follow these guidelines without deviation:

**A. Testing Framework and Syntax**
*   **Use `pytest`**: All generated test code must use the `pytest` framework and its conventions.
*   **Use `pytest-django`**: Leverage the `pytest-django` plugin for seamless Django integration.
*   **Database Access**: For any test function or method that requires database access, you MUST use the `@pytest.mark.django_db` decorator.
    - For tests requiring transactions, use `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)`
    - For tests using multiple databases, use `@pytest.mark.django_db(databases=['default', 'other'])`
*   **Assertions**: Use Python's native `assert` statement for all checks. Assertions should be simple, clear, and specific (e.g., `assert response.status_code == 200`, `assert "Success" in response.content.decode()`, `assert MyModel.objects.exists()`).
*   **Async Tests**: For async views, use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` and `async def test_*` with the appropriate async fixtures (`async_client`, `async_rf`).

**B. Test Data Management**
*   **Use `factory_boy`**: ALWAYS use `factory_boy` to generate model instances for your tests. Do NOT create model instances manually (e.g., `MyModel.objects.create(...)`) inside test functions.
*   **Assume Factories Exist**: Work under the assumption that a `factories.py` file exists in the relevant app and contains factories for all models. For example, if you need a `User` instance, use `UserFactory()`.
*   **Factory Best Practices**:
    - Use `factory.Sequence` for unique sequential values
    - Use `factory.Faker` for realistic test data
    - Use `factory.SubFactory` for related models
    - Use `factory.post_generation` for many-to-many relationships
    - Use `factory.django.mute_signals` when Django signals interfere with factory creation

**C. Test Structure and Organization**
*   **File Naming**: Place tests in files that mirror the application's structure. For example, tests for `models.py` go in `test_models.py`, tests for `views.py` go in `test_views.py`, and so on.
*   **Use `pytest` Fixtures for Setup**:
    - Use built-in fixtures like `client`, `admin_client`, `rf` (RequestFactory), `django_user_model`
    - Use `db` fixture for database access (automatically included with `@pytest.mark.django_db`)
    - Use `settings` fixture to temporarily modify Django settings
    - Use `mailoutbox` fixture to test email sending
    - Prefer function-scoped fixtures (the default) to ensure test isolation
    - Use class-scoped fixtures (`@pytest.fixture(scope="class")`) only for expensive setup that does not change between tests within a class
*   **Test Isolation**: Every test function must be completely independent. It should run successfully on its own and in any order with other tests. Do not create tests that depend on the state left by a previous test.
*   **Test Classes**: Group related tests into classes for better organization, especially for testing a specific view or model. Use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.django_db` at the class level if all methods need database access.

**D. Mocking and External Dependencies**
*   **Isolate Unit Tests**: For unit tests of services, helpers, or model methods, use the `mocker` fixture (from `pytest-mock`) to patch external dependencies like API calls, file system access, or email services. This ensures the component is tested in isolation.
*   **Use Django's Test Tools**: Leverage `django_assert_num_queries` and `django_assert_max_num_queries` fixtures for query count assertions.

**E. Code Quality**
*   **PEP 8 Compliance**: All generated Python code must be strictly compliant with PEP 8 style guidelines.
*   **Readability**: Write clean, readable code. Use descriptive variable names and test method names that clearly indicate what is being tested.
*   **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to test methods that explain what behavior is being tested, especially for complex tests.

**F. Modern Patterns and Anti-Patterns**
*   **DO use**: 
    - pytest fixtures instead of setUp/tearDown methods
    - `factory_boy` instead of manual object creation
    - `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for testing multiple scenarios
    - `django_capture_on_commit_callbacks` for testing database transactions
*   **DON'T use**:
    - `unittest.TestCase` - use pytest style tests
    - Django's `TestCase` class - use pytest fixtures and marks
    - Manual test data creation - use factories
    - `self.assertEqual()` - use `assert` statements

## 3. Required Context from User

To generate the best possible tests, I require the following context. Please provide the relevant code snippets inside the designated markdown blocks.

### `models.py`
```python
# Paste your model definitions here
```

### `views.py`
```python
# Paste your view definitions here
```

### `forms.py`
```python
# Paste your form definitions here
```

### `urls.py`
```python
# Paste your URL patterns here
```

### `factories.py` (Optional, but helpful)
```python
# Paste your factory_boy definitions here
```

### `serializers.py` (For DRF projects)
```python
# Paste your serializer definitions here
```

## 4. Your Specific Request

Based on the code provided above, describe the testing task. Be specific about what functionality and which scenarios you want to test.

**Common Test Scenarios to Consider:**
- Authentication and permissions (authenticated vs unauthenticated users)
- Valid and invalid form/serializer data
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Query count optimization
- Signal handling
- Async view behavior
- File upload handling
- Email sending
- Custom model methods and properties
- Custom manager methods
- Template usage and context data
- Redirect behavior
- Error handling and status codes

**Example Request:**
> "Generate the tests for the `ProductCreateView` in `test_views.py`. The tests should cover the following scenarios:
> 1. An authenticated user can successfully access the page (GET request).
> 2. An authenticated user can successfully submit the form with valid data (POST request) and is redirected.
> 3. An authenticated user sees form errors when submitting invalid data (POST request).
> 4. An unauthenticated user is redirected to the login page when trying to access the view."

## 5. Additional Best Practices

**Performance Testing:**
- Use `django_assert_num_queries` to ensure views don't have N+1 query problems
- Test with realistic data volumes when performance is critical

**Testing File Uploads:**
- Use `SimpleUploadedFile` or `factory.django.FileField`/`ImageField`
- Always clean up uploaded files after tests

**Testing Permissions:**
- Test each permission level separately
- Use factories to create users with different permission sets

**Testing Forms:**
- Test form validation with both valid and invalid data
- Test all custom validation methods
- Test form initialization with different data

**Testing Templates:**
- Use `assertTemplateUsed` (from `pytest_django.asserts`)
- Verify context variables are correctly passed
- Test conditional template blocks

**Example Test Structure:**
```python
import pytest
from pytest_django.asserts import assertTemplateUsed

from myapp.factories import UserFactory, ProductFactory


class TestProductListView:
    """Test cases for ProductListView."""
    
    pytestmark = pytest.mark.django_db
    
    def test_anonymous_user_can_view_products(self, client):
        """Anonymous users should be able to view the product list."""
        ProductFactory.create_batch(3)
        
        response = client.get('/products/')
        
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assertTemplateUsed(response, 'products/list.html')
        assert len(response.context['products']) == 3
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('page', [1, 2, 3])
    def test_pagination_works_correctly(self, client, page):
        """Test that pagination displays correct products."""
        ProductFactory.create_batch(25)  # Assuming 10 per page
        
        response = client.get(f'/products/?page={page}')
        
        assert response.status_code == 200
        products = response.context['products']
        assert len(products) <= 10
```
