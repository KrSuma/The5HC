## June 9, 2024 - Initial Documentation

**Author**: Claude  
**Change Type**: Documentation Update

### Summary
Updated CLAUDE.md to include change logging requirements and Django migration project information.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Added Change Logging Requirements Section
- **Location**: Under "Workflow Conventions"
- **Purpose**: Ensure all significant changes are properly documented
- **Content**:
  - Requirements for creating change log files
  - Standard log format template
  - Guidelines on when to create logs
  - Examples of log types (phase completion, features, migrations)

### 2. Added Django Migration Project Section
- **Location**: End of document
- **Purpose**: Document the ongoing Django migration project
- **Content**:
  - Migration status (Phase 1 completed)
  - Django project structure overview
  - Key migration documents references
  - Django-specific commands
  - Technology stack summary

## Modified Files
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added two new sections with ~70 lines of documentation

## Rationale
1. **Change Logging**: Ensures transparency and traceability of all major changes to the codebase
2. **Django Documentation**: Provides quick reference for the Django migration project within the main knowledge base

## Impact
- Future changes will be properly logged following the new guidelines
- Django migration work is now documented in the main project knowledge base
- Improved project documentation and maintainability

## Next Steps
- Follow the change logging requirements for all future significant changes
- Update Django migration status in CLAUDE.md as phases are completed
