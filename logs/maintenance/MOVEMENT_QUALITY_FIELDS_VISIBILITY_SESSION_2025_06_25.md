# Movement Quality Fields Visibility Investigation Session

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Author**: Claude
**Session Type**: Troubleshooting/Investigation

## Summary

User reported missing movement quality fields in the 체력 평가 등록 (Physical Assessment Registration) form, specifically in the 오버헤드 스쿼트 (Overhead Squat) section. Investigation revealed that all fields were properly implemented but initially not visible to the user.

## Issue Description

User reported seeing only:
- 점수 (Score) field
- 메모 (Notes) field

Missing fields:
- 동작 보상 (Movement Compensation) checkboxes
- 수행 품질 (Performance Quality) dropdown

## Investigation Process

### 1. Code Review
Verified implementation across all layers:

#### Model Layer (`/apps/assessments/models.py`)
- ✅ `overhead_squat_arm_drop` (BooleanField)
- ✅ `overhead_squat_quality` (CharField with choices)
- ✅ `toe_touch_flexibility` (CharField with choices)
- ✅ `shoulder_mobility_category` (CharField with choices)

All fields added in migration `0011_add_movement_quality_details.py` (2025-06-19)

#### Form Layer (`/apps/assessments/forms/assessment_forms.py`)
- ✅ All fields included in form's fields list
- ✅ Proper widget configuration with Alpine.js integration
- ✅ Korean labels and styling applied

#### Template Layer (`/templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html`)
- ✅ Movement compensation checkboxes (lines 119-140)
- ✅ Performance quality dropdown (lines 142-146)
- ✅ Toe touch flexibility dropdown (lines 325-326)
- ✅ Shoulder mobility category dropdown (lines 367-368)

### 2. Database Verification
```bash
python manage.py showmigrations assessments
# Result: [X] 0011_add_movement_quality_details (applied)
```

### 3. Runtime Verification
Created diagnostic scripts to verify:
- Model fields exist with correct choices
- Form includes all fields with proper widgets
- Total of 42 fields in AssessmentForm

## Root Cause

The fields were properly implemented but not visible due to:
1. **Browser cache** - Cached version of the form without new fields
2. **Page load timing** - Fields may not have been fully rendered on initial load

## Resolution

User performed a page refresh and the fields became visible:
- 동작 보상 (Movement Compensation) section appeared
- 수행 품질 (Performance Quality) dropdown appeared

## Fields Confirmed Working

### Overhead Squat Section
1. **동작 보상** checkboxes:
   - 무릎이 안쪽으로 모임 (Knee valgus)
   - 과도한 전방 기울임 (Forward lean)
   - 발뒤꿈치 들림 (Heel lift)
   - 팔 전방 하강 (Arm drop)

2. **수행 품질** dropdown:
   - 동작 중 통증 발생
   - 깊은 스쿼트 수행 불가능
   - 보상 동작 관찰됨
   - 완벽한 동작

### Toe Touch Section
**유연성 평가** dropdown:
- 손끝이 발에 닿지 않음
- 손끝이 발에 닿음
- 손바닥이 발등을 덮음
- 손바닥이 발에 완전히 닿음

### Shoulder Mobility Section
**양손 간 거리 평가** dropdown:
- 동작 중 통증
- 손 간 거리가 신장 1.5배 이상
- 손 간 거리가 신장 1~1.5배
- 손 간 거리가 신장 1배 미만

## Lessons Learned

1. Movement quality assessment fields have been fully implemented since 2025-06-19
2. Browser caching can hide newly added form fields
3. All quality assessment fields are properly integrated with scoring calculations
4. The implementation includes comprehensive options for movement quality evaluation

## Recommendations

For users experiencing similar issues:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Restart development server if running locally
