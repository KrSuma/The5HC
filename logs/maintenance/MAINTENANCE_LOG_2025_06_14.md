## Git Status

Many files showing as deleted (D) in git status - these appear to be from a previous cleanup effort that needs to be committed.

## Remaining TODOs

1. **Password Reset Email** (Medium Priority)
   - Location: `apps/accounts/views.py` line 139
   - Need to implement email sending logic

2. **API Session Package Expiration** (Low Priority)
   - Location: `apps/api/views.py` line 168
   - Improve expiration date filtering

3. **Trainers App** (Low Priority)
   - Currently just a placeholder
   - Needs full implementation

## Notes

- PDF generation was already 95% implemented - just needed to remove blocking code
- WeasyPrint shows font warnings but PDFs generate correctly
- Consider committing the pending git deletions to finalize previous cleanup
