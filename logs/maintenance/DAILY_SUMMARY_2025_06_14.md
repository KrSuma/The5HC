## Overview

Today's work focused on enabling PDF report generation and fixing HTMX navigation issues. Both features are now fully functional in the production system.

## Session 1: PDF Report Generation

### Problem Solved
- Assessment detail page showed "PDF 리포트 기능은 준비 중입니다" message
- PDF generation was actually 95% implemented but blocked by conflicting routes

### Solution
- Removed conflicting URL pattern in assessments app
- Fixed field mappings in report service
- Updated template variables
- Result: PDF generation now fully functional

### Key Learning
- Always check for existing implementations before adding new features
- URL routing conflicts can block working features

## Session 2: HTMX Navigation Fix

### Problem Solved
- Navigation links showed different content than page refresh
- HTMX was loading only partial templates for nav requests

### Solution
- Fixed URL reference error in assessment list template
- Enhanced view logic to detect navigation vs partial update requests
- Result: Consistent page display regardless of access method

### Key Learning
- HTMX requires careful handling of full vs partial page updates
- Header inspection (`HX-Target`) can differentiate request types
