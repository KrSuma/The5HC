**Issue**: JavaScript "Unexpected end of script" errors during HTMX navigation

## Summary

Fixed JavaScript execution errors that occurred when navigating to assessment detail pages using HTMX. The errors were caused by immediate script execution in HTMX-loaded content.

## Changes Made

### 1. `templates/assessments/assessment_detail_content.html`
- Refactored Chart.js initialization from IIFE to event-driven function
- Added proper event listeners for DOMContentLoaded and htmx:afterSwap
- Removed strict mode incompatible `arguments.callee`
- Added 50ms delay for DOM readiness
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. Key Changes
```javascript
// Old approach - problematic IIFE
(function() {
    'use strict';
    // Immediate execution caused issues
})();

// New approach - event-driven
function initChart() {
    // Chart initialization
}
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initChart);
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:afterSwap', function(evt) {
    if (evt.detail.target.id === 'main-content') {
        setTimeout(initChart, 50);
    }
});
```

## Root Cause

1. HTMX loads content dynamically and executes scripts differently than full page loads
2. Scripts were executing before DOM was ready
3. Strict mode with arguments.callee caused syntax errors
4. Chart.js might not be available immediately in HTMX context

## Testing

Test by navigating between assessment list and detail pages. Chart should render without errors.

## Next Steps

Apply the same fix to `templates/assessments/assessment_detail.html` if needed.
