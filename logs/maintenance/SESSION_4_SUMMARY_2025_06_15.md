## Recommended Next Step

**Performance Optimization** appears to be the highest priority based on:

- It directly impacts user experience
- Database queries could be optimized for the new multi-trainer architecture
- Page load times are critical for production usage

Alternative: If user prefers, completing Korean translation coverage would be a good quick win before tackling the larger performance optimization task.
