# Session Log - Phase 6 Production Deployment

**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Author**: Claude  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Primary Task**: Deploy Django application to Heroku production

## Session Overview

Successfully completed Phase 6 of The5HC migration project by deploying the Django application to Heroku production environment. This marks the completion of the entire migration from Streamlit to Django.

## Activities Performed

### 1. Initial Setup and Planning
- Created Phase 6 deployment plan documentation
- Updated deployment configuration files
- Created deployment scripts for automation

### 2. Configuration Updates
- **Procfile**: Removed `cd django_migration` prefix for root deployment
- **runtime.txt**: Confirmed python-3.12.1 
- **Aptfile**: Created for WeasyPrint system dependencies
- **.env.example**: Created as environment variable reference

### 3. Production Settings Fixes
- Fixed CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for Django 4.0+ compatibility
- Updated logging configuration for Heroku stdout
- Added CORS settings for API access
- Fixed ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration

### 4. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set required environment variables
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=[generated]
heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=the5hc.settings.production
heroku config:set DEBUG=False
heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS=the5hc.herokuapp.com,the5hc-ed48c8d8fe2e.herokuapp.com
```

### 5. Deployment Process
- Initial deployment attempt failed due to missing SECRET_KEY
- Second attempt failed due to existing Streamlit tables in database
- Reset PostgreSQL database completely
- Third deployment succeeded after ALLOWED_HOSTS fix
- All Django migrations applied successfully

### 6. Post-Deployment Cleanup
- Moved deployment files to appropriate directories:
  - `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/deployment/`
  - `PHASE5_PREPARATION.md` → `docs/migration/`
  - `PHASE6_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` → `docs/migration/`
- Removed duplicate `PHASE6_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Phase 6 completion status
- Added production URL to project overview

## Files Created

1. `/docs/PHASE6_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`
2. `/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` 
3. `/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (moved to docs/deployment/)
4. `/.env.example`
5. `/Aptfile`
6. `/scripts/deploy_to_heroku.sh`
7. `/scripts/redeploy_to_heroku.sh`
8. `/scripts/prepare_fresh_database.sh`
9. `/logs/migration/PHASE6_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_LOG.md`

## Files Modified

1. `/Procfile` - Updated for root directory
2. `/the5hc/settings/production.py` - Fixed CSRF and logging
3. `/the5hc/settings/base.py` - CSRF settings update
4. `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated project status and added production URL

## Issues Resolved

1. **SECRET_KEY not found**: Set environment variable
2. **Database migration conflict**: Reset PostgreSQL database
3. **ALLOWED_HOSTS error**: Added Heroku app URL
4. **CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS**: Fixed for Django 4.0+ requirements
