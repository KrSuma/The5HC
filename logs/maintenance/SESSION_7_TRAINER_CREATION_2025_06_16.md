  --last-name="Doe" \
  --role="trainer"

# List all trainers
python manage.py list_trainers

## Notes

- The invitation system exists in the UI but email functionality is not implemented
- WeasyPrint warning appears when running commands but doesn't affect functionality
- Both organizations currently have generous 50 trainer limits
- The system uses Django's built-in User model extended with custom fields

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing email functionality for the invitation system
2. Add bulk trainer import functionality if needed
3. Consider adding a command to modify existing trainers
4. Add commands for managing organizations
