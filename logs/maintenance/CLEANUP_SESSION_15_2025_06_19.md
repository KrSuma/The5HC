**Session**: Post-MCQ Score Fix Cleanup

## Summary

Performed cleanup and documentation updates after fixing MCQ score persistence and assessment detail UI consistency issues.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added Session 15 entry for MCQ Score Persistence and UI Consistency Fixes
- Listed all fixes implemented:
  - MCQ score persistence fix
  - Category name mismatch resolution
  - Assessment detail template unification
  - Double header/footer fix
- Moved Session 14 from "Current" to completed sessions
- Updated file structure date to Session 15
- Added new log reference: `logs/maintenance/MCQ_SCORE_FIX_SESSION_2025_06_19.md`

### 2. Created Documentation
- Created comprehensive session log: `logs/maintenance/MCQ_SCORE_FIX_SESSION_2025_06_19.md`
- Documented all issues addressed and solutions implemented
- Added testing notes and navigation instructions

### 3. File Cleanup
- Found 1 outdated file: `templates/assessments/assessment_detail_partial.html.old`
  - This was intentionally renamed to .old to prevent its use
  - The outdated partial template showed radar charts with old scoring system
- Kept debug template `mcq_assessment_debug.html` as it's still referenced in views
- No other temporary or backup files found that need cleanup

### 4. Directory Structure Status
- Total log files: 101 markdown files
- All files properly organized in feature/maintenance/archive structure
- No unnecessary files in root directory
- Project structure remains clean and organized

## Current Project State

### Session 15 Achievements
- ✅ MCQ scores now persist correctly to database
- ✅ Assessment detail page shows consistent modern view
- ✅ Fixed double header/footer issue with proper HTMX pattern
- ✅ Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Resolved category name mismatches in scoring engine

### File Organization
- ✅ CLAUDE.md up to date with Session 15
- ✅ Session log created and comprehensive
- ✅ No unnecessary cleanup needed
- ✅ All templates follow HTMX navigation pattern

### Known Issues Resolved
- MCQ scores not showing after completion - FIXED
- Different views on same URL (radar vs bar chart) - FIXED
- Double headers/footers on assessment detail - FIXED
- No navigation to assessment detail - CLARIFIED (use "평가 관리" in navbar)

## Notes

1. The `.old` file is intentionally kept renamed to prevent accidental use while preserving the code for reference if needed.

2. Debug logging was added but can be removed once MCQ scoring is confirmed working in production.

3. The assessment detail now uses a consistent modern view with:
   - Bar charts instead of radar charts
   - Injury risk assessment
   - Percentile rankings
   - MCQ integration
   - Scores as percentages (0-100%)

## Session Summary

Successfully fixed critical MCQ score persistence issues and unified the assessment detail UI for consistency. All documentation updated and project remains well-organized.
