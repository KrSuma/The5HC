# Session 11: MCQ System Planning and Documentation Update

**Date**: 2025-06-19
**Author**: Claude
**Session Type**: Planning and Maintenance

## Summary

This session focused on analyzing the Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) requirements from `additional-questions.md` and creating a comprehensive implementation plan. The plan outlines 10 phases to add knowledge, lifestyle, and readiness assessments to complement the existing physical fitness assessments.

## Work Completed

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Reviewed `additional-questions.md` to understand MCQ system requirements
- Compared current implementation with target state
- Identified all missing components across 10 implementation phases

### 2. Implementation Plan Creation
- Created comprehensive implementation plan at `/tasks/mcq-implementation-plan.md`
- Detailed breakdown of all 10 phases with specific tasks
- Estimated 4-week timeline for complete implementation
- Defined scoring weights: Physical (60%), Knowledge (15%), Lifestyle (15%), Readiness (10%)

### 3. Task Management
- Added 11 tasks to todo list covering all implementation phases
- Prioritized tasks based on dependencies and importance
- Added review task for the implementation plan

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md with today's session details
- Prepared for next implementation phase
- Organized project structure for MCQ development

## Key Decisions

### 1. Scoring System Design
The comprehensive scoring will combine:
- **Physical Assessment**: 60% (existing tests)
- **Knowledge Assessment**: 15% (exercise form, nutrition, recovery)
- **Lifestyle Assessment**: 15% (sleep, stress, diet, hydration)
- **Readiness Assessment**: 10% (pain, recovery status, motivation)

### 2. Implementation Approach
- Phase 1-2: Core database and scoring (High priority)
- Phase 3-4: Forms and UI (High/Medium priority)
- Phase 5-8: API, Admin, Testing (Medium priority)
- Phase 9-10: Reports and Deployment (Medium/High priority)

### 3. Question Categories
Defined three main categories:
- **Knowledge**: Exercise principles, nutrition, recovery, injury prevention
- **Lifestyle**: Daily habits affecting fitness performance
- **Readiness**: Current state evaluation for safe training

## Technical Specifications

### New Models Required
1. `QuestionCategory` - Categories with weights for scoring
2. `MultipleChoiceQuestion` - Questions with types (single, multiple, scale)
3. `QuestionChoice` - Answer options with points and risk weights
4. `QuestionResponse` - User responses to questions

### Key Features
- Conditional questions (show/hide based on answers)
- Multi-language support (Korean/English)
- Real-time score preview
- Risk factor integration
- API endpoints for external apps

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/tasks/mcq-implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan
- `/logs/maintenance/SESSION_11_MCQ_PLANNING_2025_06_19.md` - This session log

### To Be Created (Phase 1)
- `apps/assessments/models.py` - Add MCQ models
- `apps/assessments/scoring/mcq_scoring.py` - MCQ scoring engine
- `apps/assessments/forms/mcq_forms.py` - Dynamic MCQ forms

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Implementation** (2-3 days)
   - Create MCQ database models
   - Add fields to Assessment model
   - Create initial migrations

2. **Phase 2 Implementation** (2 days)
   - Create MCQScoringEngine class
   - Integrate with existing scoring system
   - Implement weighted calculations

3. **Preparation Tasks**
   - Set up development branch for MCQ feature
   - Review database schema design
   - Create test data structure

## Notes

- The MCQ system will transform The5HC from a physical assessment tool into a comprehensive fitness evaluation platform
- Implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing assessments
- All existing features remain functional during MCQ development
- The system is designed for future expansion with additional question banks
