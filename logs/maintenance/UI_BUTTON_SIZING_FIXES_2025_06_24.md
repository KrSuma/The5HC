**Session**: 17 - UI Consistency Improvements

## Summary

Fixed button sizing inconsistencies across multiple pages and corrected the step indicator line alignment in the assessment form. Standardized all action buttons to use `px-6 py-2.5` padding for better visual consistency and appropriate sizing for Korean text.

## Issues Identified

1. **Button Sizing Inconsistency**: Many buttons were using `px-4 py-2` instead of the standard `px-6 py-2.5`
2. **Step Indicator Lines**: Connecting lines between step numbers were positioned at the bottom of circles instead of center

## Changes Made

#### Files Modified:

   - "이전" (Previous) button
   - "취소" (Cancel) link
   - "다음" (Next) button
   - "평가 저장" (Save Assessment) button

2. **Step Indicator Line Fix**:
   ```css
   /* Before - Line at bottom of circles */
   .step:not(:last-child)::after {
       top: 50%;
   }
   
   /* After - Line at center of circles */
   .step:not(:last-child)::after {
       top: calc(1rem + 1.25rem); /* padding + half of step-number height */
   }
   ```

## Technical Details

### Button Sizing Standard
- **Before**: `px-4 py-2` (16px horizontal, 8px vertical padding)
- **After**: `px-6 py-2.5` (24px horizontal, 10px vertical padding)
- **Rationale**: Provides better touch targets and visual balance for Korean text

### Step Indicator Calculation
- Step container padding: 1rem
- Step number circle height: 2.5rem
- Line position: 1rem + 1.25rem = 2.25rem from container top
- This centers the line on the numbered circles

## Testing Notes

All changes tested and verified:
- ✅ Button sizes consistent across all pages
- ✅ Korean text displays properly without truncation
- ✅ Step indicator lines properly centered on circles
- ✅ Visual consistency improved throughout application
- ✅ No functionality affected, only visual improvements

}
```
