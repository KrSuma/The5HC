# Assessment Form HTMX Navigation Fix Log

**Date**: 2025-06-15

**Issue**: Double header/footer on assessment registration page

## Summary

Fixed the double header and footer issue on the "체력평가등록" (Assessment registration) page by implementing the HTMX navigation pattern.

## Issue Description

The assessment add/registration page was showing duplicate headers and footers when accessed through HTMX navigation, similar to previous issues with other views.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Content-Only Template**
   - Created `templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html`
   - This template contains the same content as `assessment_form.html` but without extending `base.html`
   - Includes all necessary scripts (Chart.js, Alpine.js component) and styles

2. **Updated View Logic**
   - Modified `assessment_add_view` in `apps/assessments/views.py`
   - Added HTMX navigation detection:
     ```python
     if request.headers.get('HX-Request') and request.headers.get('HX-Target') == 'main-content':
         return render(request, 'assessments/assessment_form_content.html', context)
     ```

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added the assessment form fix to `docs/HTMX_NAVIGATION_PATTERN.md`

## Files Modified

1. `apps/assessments/views.py` - Added HTMX navigation handling
2. `templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html` - Created new content-only template
3. `docs/HTMX_NAVIGATION_PATTERN.md` - Updated with new fixed view

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the assessment form directly by URL - should show full page with header/footer
2. Click on "체력평가등록" from navbar or any HTMX navigation - should NOT show duplicate headers/footers
3. All form functionality (multi-step, score calculations, etc.) should work correctly
4. Form submission should work properly with HTMX

## Additional Notes

- The assessment delete view also returns a template (`assessment_confirm_delete.html`) that doesn't exist in the templates directory. This might need to be addressed separately.
- The fix follows the established pattern used for other views (client add/edit, assessment list, etc.)
- All Alpine.js functionality and Chart.js visualizations are preserved in the content-only template

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix in development environment
2. Consider creating the missing `assessment_confirm_delete.html` template
3. Review other views that might need similar treatment
