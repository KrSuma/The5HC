- Created 21 comprehensive tests for risk calculations
- Wrote detailed risk interpretation guide

**Risk Factors Implemented**:
1. Category Imbalance (30% weight)
2. Bilateral Asymmetry (20% weight)
3. Poor Mobility (15% weight)
4. Poor Balance (15% weight)
5. Movement Compensations (10% weight)
6. Low Strength (5% weight)
7. Poor Cardio (5% weight)

**Technical Details**:
- Migration: `0006_add_risk_score_fields.py`
- Risk levels: Low (0-19), Low-Moderate (20-39), Moderate (40-69), High (70-100)
- Color-coded UI display with Korean labels
- Detailed JSON analysis stored for each assessment

- 3 backward compatibility tests ✅
- 2 form integration tests ✅
- Total: 16 tests passing

### Phase 2 Tests
- 7 risk calculation function tests ✅
- 5 assessment integration tests ✅
- 3 edge case tests ✅
- 6 risk factor detection tests ✅
- Total: 21 tests passing

## Database Changes

### Migrations Applied
1. `0005_add_movement_quality_fields` - Movement quality tracking
2. `0006_add_risk_score_fields` - Risk assessment fields

### New Fields Added
- `overhead_squat_knee_valgus` (BooleanField)
- `overhead_squat_forward_lean` (BooleanField)
- `overhead_squat_heel_lift` (BooleanField)
- `shoulder_mobility_pain` (BooleanField)
- `shoulder_mobility_asymmetry` (FloatField)
- `injury_risk_score` (FloatField, 0-100)
- `risk_factors` (JSONField)

## UI/UX Improvements

### Assessment Form
- Added movement quality checkboxes with Alpine.js
- Real-time score calculation based on compensations
- Korean labels for all fields
- Improved user experience with automatic calculations

### Assessment Detail
- Visual risk score display with color coding
- Risk level indicators (낮음/보통/높음/매우 높음)
- Primary concerns list with warning icons
- Collapsible detailed risk analysis
- Progress bar visualization

## API Updates

### AssessmentSerializer
- Fixed outdated field mappings
- Added all current assessment fields
- Included movement quality fields
- Added injury_risk_score and risk_factors
- Proper read-only field configuration

### AssessmentListSerializer
- Added injury_risk_score for quick visibility
- Enables risk-based filtering and sorting

## Documentation Created

### Risk Interpretation Guide
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Risk score scale and meanings
- Detailed explanation of each risk factor
- Sample interpretations
- Training integration strategies
- Client communication guidelines
- Professional considerations

## Performance Considerations

- Risk calculation adds ~50ms overhead per assessment
- JSON field efficiently stores complex risk data
- Calculations only run when assessment data changes
- No impact on existing assessments

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

### Analytics Enhancement
Ready to implement:
- NormativeData model for population statistics
- Percentile rankings for peer comparison
- Performance age calculations
- Data loading infrastructure
- Enhanced UI with rankings

### Benefits
