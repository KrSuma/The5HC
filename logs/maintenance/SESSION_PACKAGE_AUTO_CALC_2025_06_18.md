# Session Package Auto-Calculation Enhancement - 2025-06-18

**Date**: 2025-06-18

**Feature**: Automatic Total Sessions Calculation

## Summary

Enhanced the session package form to automatically calculate the total number of sessions based on the total amount and session price, improving user experience and reducing manual calculation errors.

## Changes Made

### File: `templates/sessions/package_form.html`

1. **Added help text** to inform users that total sessions will be auto-calculated
2. **Updated `calculateFees()` function** to automatically compute total sessions when both total amount and session price are entered
3. **Simplified `onSessionPriceChange()` function** to remove the circular update prevention logic
4. **Modified `onTotalSessionsChange()` function** to only recalculate session price when user manually changes total sessions

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users had to manually calculate total sessions based on total amount and price per session
- Risk of calculation errors and inconsistencies

### After
- Total sessions automatically calculated when:
  - User enters total amount and session price
  - User changes session price (with total amount already entered)
- User can still manually override total sessions if needed
- When manually changing sessions, the session price is recalculated

## Technical Implementation

The calculation follows this priority:
1. **Primary inputs**: Total amount (총 금액) and Session price (세션당 가격)
2. **Auto-calculated**: Total sessions = Total amount ÷ Session price (rounded)
3. **Manual override**: If user changes total sessions directly, session price is recalculated

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to 세션 패키지 추가 (Add Session Package)
2. Select a client
3. Enter package name
4. Enter total amount (e.g., 500,000)
5. Enter session price (e.g., 50,000)
6. Observe that total sessions is automatically calculated (10)
7. Try changing session price - total sessions should update
8. Try manually changing total sessions - session price should update
