## Cleanup Principles Established

1. **Consolidation**: Merge related logs and documentation
2. **Organization**: Use clear subdirectory structure
3. **Archival**: Preserve historical information when valuable
4. **Clarity**: Maintain clear naming conventions
5. **Documentation**: Log all significant changes

## Current Structure

```
logs/
├── feature/          # Feature implementation logs
├── maintenance/      # Cleanup and maintenance logs
├── migration/        # Phase migration logs
└── archive/          # Historical/completed work
    └── streamlit-migration/  # Streamlit-related archives
```

## Metrics

- **Files Deleted**: ~150+ (mostly Streamlit)
- **Files Reorganized**: ~100+ (Django structure)
- **Documentation Created**: 25+ markdown files
- **Log Consolidation**: 40+ logs → ~20 logs
- **Structure Improvement**: 3 major reorganizations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental Cleanup**: Better than one massive change
2. **Documentation First**: Document before deleting
3. **Archive vs Delete**: Archive when historical value exists
4. **Clear Categories**: Organize logs by type, not just date
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule periodic cleanup sessions
