# HTMX Navigation Duplicate Header/Footer Fix

**Issue**: Duplicate header/footer in client edit page when navigating via HTMX

## Summary

Fixed the duplicate header/footer issue that occurred when navigating to certain pages using HTMX navigation (navbar links). The issue was caused by views returning full pages (with base.html) instead of content-only templates for HTMX navigation requests.

## Root Cause

When users click navbar links, HTMX loads content into the `#main-content` div. If the view returns a full page (extending base.html), it results in nested headers/footers within the main content area.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Detection Pattern

Added logic to detect HTMX navigation requests by checking:
- `HX-Request` header (indicates HTMX request)
- `HX-Target` header equals "main-content" (indicates navbar navigation)

### 2. Template Structure

Created content-only templates that don't extend base.html for HTMX navigation requests.

## Files Modified

### 1. Client Views (`apps/clients/views.py`)
- `client_add_view`: Added HTMX navigation detection
- `client_edit_view`: Added HTMX navigation detection  
- `client_detail_view`: Added HTMX navigation detection

### 2. New Templates Created
- `/templates/clients/client_form_content.html`: Content-only version of client form
- `/templates/clients/client_detail_content.html`: Content-only version of client detail

### 3. Documentation
- Created `/docs/HTMX_NAVIGATION_PATTERN.md`: Comprehensive guide for handling HTMX navigation

## Implementation Details

### View Pattern
```python
# Check if this is an HTMX navigation request (navbar click)
# HX-Target will be #main-content for navbar navigation
if request.headers.get('HX-Request') and request.headers.get('HX-Target') == 'main-content':
    return render(request, 'template_content.html', context)

# Regular request - return full page
return render(request, 'template.html', context)
```

## Testing Performed

1. Direct URL access - Shows full page correctly
2. Navbar navigation - No duplicate headers/footers
3. Form submissions - Still work correctly
4. Browser back/forward - Functions properly

## Views Already Fixed (Previously)

Based on the codebase analysis:
- Assessment List view already implements this pattern
- Other views may need similar fixes as issues are discovered

## Recommendations

1. **Systematic Review**: Review all views accessible from navbar to ensure they implement this pattern
2. **Testing**: Test each navbar link for duplicate header/footer issues
3. **Future Development**: Consider creating a decorator or middleware to handle this automatically
4. **Team Training**: Ensure all developers understand this pattern for new views

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for similar issues in other views
2. Consider implementing automated solution (decorator/middleware)
3. Add this pattern to development guidelines
4. Update view creation templates to include this pattern by default
