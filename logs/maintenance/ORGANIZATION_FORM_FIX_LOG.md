**Issue**: TemplateDoesNotExist error when accessing organization settings

## Summary

Fixed missing organization form templates that were causing a TemplateDoesNotExist error when trying to edit organization settings.

## Problem

When clicking the "Settings" button in the organization dashboard, the application threw:
```
django.template.exceptions.TemplateDoesNotExist: trainers/organization_form_content.html
```

The organization edit view was trying to use HTMX navigation pattern templates that didn't exist.

## Solution

Created the missing templates following the established HTMX navigation pattern:

### 1. Created Regular Template
**File**: `/templates/trainers/organization_form.html`
- Extends base.html
- Includes the content-only template

### 2. Created Content-Only Template  
**File**: `/templates/trainers/organization_form_content.html`
- Contains the full organization edit form
- Includes all form fields from OrganizationForm
- Proper HTMX attributes for form submission
- Styled with Tailwind CSS classes
- Added "Danger Zone" section for organization owners

### 3. Fixed Template Issues
- Removed reference to non-existent `business_number` field
- Added missing `email` and `timezone` fields
- Ensured all fields match the OrganizationForm definition

## Form Features

The organization form now includes:
- Organization name, phone, address
- Contact email and timezone settings
- Description and max trainers limit
- Organization metadata (created, updated, owner)
- Danger zone for organization deletion (owners only)
- Proper HTMX form submission with loading indicators

## Testing

1. Navigate to organization dashboard
2. Click "Settings" button
3. Form should load without errors
4. All fields should be editable
5. Save changes should work via HTMX

## Additional Fixes

### Template Variable Errors
- Fixed `VariableDoesNotExist` error for organization.owner
- Organization model doesn't have a direct owner field
- Owner is determined by Trainer with role='owner'
- Updated template to iterate through trainers to find owner
- Fixed danger zone visibility check to use request.trainer.role

## Notes

- The form properly handles HTMX navigation requests
- Follows the same pattern as other forms in the application
- Only organization owners see the danger zone section
- Delete organization feature shows alert (not yet implemented)
- Owner is identified by trainer role, not a direct field
