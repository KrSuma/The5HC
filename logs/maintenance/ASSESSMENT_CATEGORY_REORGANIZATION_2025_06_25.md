# Physical Assessment Test Category Reorganization

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Author**: Claude
**Session**: 18
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary

Reorganized physical assessment test categories per client request to better group related fitness tests. Moved Overhead Squat from Strength category to Balance & Coordination category, updated all related UI elements, and fixed field name inconsistencies.

## Background

The client requested reorganizing the test categories to better reflect the nature of each test:
- Move Overhead Squat from strength assessment to balance/coordination
- Group tests more logically based on what they measure
- Update all UI labels to match the new organization

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Category Reorganization

**New Structure**:
- **Step 2 - 근력 및 근지구력 (Strength & Muscular Endurance)**
  - Push-up Test
  - Farmers Carry Test

- **Step 3 - 균형 및 협응성 (Balance & Coordination)**
  - Overhead Squat (moved from Step 2)
  - Single Leg Balance Test

- **Step 4 - 기동성 및 유연성 (Mobility & Flexibility)**
  - Toe Touch Test
  - Shoulder Mobility Test

- **Step 5 - 심폐지구력 (Cardiovascular Endurance)**
  - Harvard Step Test

### 2. Template Updates

#### assessment_form_content.html
- Updated step indicators (lines 33-48)
- Moved overhead squat section from Step 2 to Step 3 (lines 193-236)
- Updated all section headers with new Korean labels
- Fixed JavaScript scoring calculations to match new grouping

#### assessment_form.html
- Applied identical changes to maintain consistency
- Updated step indicators and section organization
- Ensured both templates have matching structure

### 3. JavaScript Scoring Logic Updates

Updated `calculateOverallScores()` method:
```javascript
// Mobility includes toe touch AND shoulder mobility
const mobilityScores = [this.toeTouchScore, this.shoulderMobilityScore].filter(s => s !== null);

// Balance includes single leg balance AND overhead squat
const balanceScores = [this.balanceScore, this.overheadSquatScore].filter(s => s !== null);
```

### 4. Field Name Fixes

- Changed all references from `flexibility_score` to `mobility_score` in:
  - assessment_detail_content.html
  - assessment_compare_content.html
- Updated chart labels from '유연성' to '기동성'

### 5. Backend Scoring Verification

Verified that `apps/assessments/scoring.py` already correctly groups tests:
- `calculate_strength_score()`: push-up + farmers carry
- `calculate_mobility_score()`: toe touch + shoulder mobility
- `calculate_balance_score()`: single leg balance + overhead squat

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. `/templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html`
   - Lines 33-48: Step indicators
   - Lines 193-236: Overhead squat section moved
   - Lines 722-733: JavaScript scoring logic

2. `/templates/assessments/assessment_form.html`
   - Same changes as assessment_form_content.html
   - Maintained consistency between both templates

3. `/templates/assessments/assessment_detail_content.html`
   - Line 527: Changed chart label to '기동성'
   - Fixed field references

4. `/templates/assessments/assessment_compare_content.html`
   - Updated all '유연성' references to '기동성'

## Testing Notes

1. Verified step navigation works correctly
2. Confirmed overhead squat now appears in Step 3
3. Checked that scoring calculations still work properly
4. Validated that all Korean labels display correctly
5. Ensured backward compatibility with existing assessments

## Result

Successfully reorganized physical assessment test categories with:
- More logical grouping of related tests
- Consistent UI labeling throughout the application
- Proper scoring calculations maintained
- No breaking changes to existing data
