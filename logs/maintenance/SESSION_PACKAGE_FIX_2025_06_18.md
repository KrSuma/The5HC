# Session Package Form Fix - 2025-06-18

**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Author**: Claude  
**Issue**: Session Package Add View Error

## Summary

Fixed a critical error in the session package add view where the form was incorrectly receiving a User instance instead of a Trainer instance, causing a ValueError when filtering clients.

## Error Details

```
ValueError: Cannot query "krsuma - ": Must be "Trainer" instance.
```

This error occurred when trying to access `/sessions/packages/add/`.

## Root Cause

In `apps/sessions/views.py`, the `session_package_add_view` was passing `request.trainer.user` to the `SessionPackageForm`, but the form's `__init__` method expected a Trainer instance to filter the client queryset.

## Changes Made

### File: `apps/sessions/views.py`

1. **Line 109**: Changed `user=request.trainer.user` to `user=request.trainer`
2. **Line 112**: Changed `package.trainer = request.trainer.user` to `package.trainer = request.trainer`
3. **Line 154**: Changed `user=request.trainer.user` to `user=request.trainer`

## Technical Details

The `SessionPackageForm` filters clients based on the trainer relationship:
```python
self.fields['client'].queryset = Client.objects.filter(trainer=user)
```

Since the Client model has a ForeignKey to Trainer (not User), the filter expects a Trainer instance.

## Testing

After the fix:
- Session package add form should load without errors
- Client dropdown should only show clients belonging to the current trainer
- Form submission should properly assign the trainer to the package

## Related Issues

This type of User/Trainer confusion has been a recurring issue throughout the codebase during the trainer migration. Similar fixes were applied in:
- Assessment forms
- API serializers
- Client forms

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Always check the model relationships when passing user/trainer instances
2. Use consistent naming conventions (prefer `trainer` over `user` when dealing with Trainer instances)
3. Add type hints to form __init__ methods to clarify expected types
