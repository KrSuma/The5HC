# Streamlit Retention Decision Log

**Date**: 2025-06-09
**Decision**: Keep all Streamlit files until Django migration is fully complete
**Author**: Claude

## Decision Summary
After analyzing the codebase, we've decided to **retain all Streamlit files** until the Django migration is fully complete and production-ready.

## Rationale

1. **Django Migration Status**
   - Phase 3 (UI/Forms) is complete
   - Phase 4-6 still pending (PDF reports, advanced features, production deployment)
   - Not all features have been migrated yet

2. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Maintains a working fallback system
   - Allows for feature comparison and verification
   - Ensures no business logic is lost during migration

3. **Reference Value**
   - Complex scoring algorithms in `src/core/scoring.py`
   - Business logic in service layer
   - PDF generation utilities not yet implemented in Django
   - Data migration scripts still needed

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Original SQLite database still contains production data
   - Migration scripts haven't been run yet
   - Need to verify data transfer accuracy

## Future Action Plan

### When to Remove Streamlit
Remove Streamlit code only after:
1. ✅ All Django phases (1-6) are complete
2. ✅ Data migration is successfully executed and verified
3. ✅ Django version is deployed to production
4. ✅ All features are tested and working in Django
5. ✅ At least 1 month of stable Django production operation

### Removal Strategy
When ready, follow the phased approach documented in `STREAMLIT_REMOVAL_ANALYSIS.md`

## Files Created

- This decision log

## Conclusion
Keeping Streamlit code is the safe, professional approach that ensures:
- No data loss
- No feature loss  
- Smooth transition
- Ability to rollback if needed

The minor disk space usage is negligible compared to the risk of premature removal.
