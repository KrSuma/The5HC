## Key Changes

1. **Project Focus**: All documentation now clearly states this is a Django-based application
2. **Technology Stack**: Emphasized Django 5.0.1, HTMX, Alpine.js, and DRF
3. **Structure**: Documentation reflects the django_migration/ directory as the main project
4. **Commands**: All commands updated to Django-specific ones (manage.py, pytest, etc.)
5. **Deployment**: Added Heroku deployment configuration and instructions

## Verification

All files have been updated to:
- Remove Streamlit references
- Focus on Django as the primary technology
- Reflect the current project structure
- Provide accurate setup and deployment instructions
- Maintain consistency across all documentation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Heroku using the new configuration
2. Update any remaining documentation in subdirectories if needed
3. Create a migration guide for users familiar with the old Streamlit version
4. Update any external documentation or wikis to reflect the Django-only status
