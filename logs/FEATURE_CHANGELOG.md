## VAT and Card Processing Fee Implementation

## Summary

This feature introduces automatic VAT (부가세) and card processing fee (카드 수수료) calculations to the fitness assessment system's session package management.

  - Card Fee = Gross Amount × 0.035
  - Net Amount = Gross Amount - VAT Amount - Card Fee

### 2. Enhanced UI Components
- Real-time fee calculation display during package creation
