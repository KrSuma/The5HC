# Feature Changelog: VAT and Card Processing Fee Implementation

## Summary

This feature introduces automatic VAT (부가세) and card processing fee (카드 수수료) calculations to the fitness assessment system's session package management. The implementation provides transparent financial breakdowns, helping trainers understand the actual net amount after deducting the standard 10% VAT and 3.5% card processing fees from gross payments.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Fee Calculation
- **VAT Rate**: Fixed at 10% (Korean standard)
- **Card Processing Fee**: Fixed at 3.5%
- **Calculation Method**: Inclusive (fees are calculated from the gross amount)
- **Formula**:
  - VAT Amount = Gross Amount × (0.10 ÷ 1.10)
  - Card Fee = Gross Amount × 0.035
  - Net Amount = Gross Amount - VAT Amount - Card Fee

### 2. Enhanced UI Components
- Real-time fee calculation display during package creation
- Detailed fee breakdown in package management view
- Payment history with comprehensive fee information
- Visual indicators for gross amount, fees, and net credits

### 3. Database Enhancements
- New columns added to `session_packages` table for fee tracking
- Enhanced `payment_history` table with fee breakdown
- New `fee_audit_log` table for comprehensive transaction auditing
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing data

### 4. Service Layer Updates
- Enhanced `SessionManagementService` with fee calculation methods
- New methods: `create_package_with_fees()` and `add_credits_with_fees()`
- Integrated `FeeCalculator` class for consistent calculations
- Audit trail creation for all financial transactions

### New Table: `fee_audit_log`
- Comprehensive audit trail for all fee calculations
- Tracks calculation type, amounts, rates, and details
- Links to packages and payments for full traceability

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. FeeCalculator Class
```python
class FeeCalculator:
    """Handles all fee calculations with fixed Korean tax rates"""
    - Uses Decimal for precise financial calculations
    - Implements ROUND_HALF_UP for consistent rounding
    - Validates calculations to ensure accuracy
```

### 2. Enhanced Package Creation Flow
- Accepts gross amount from trainer input
- Automatically calculates VAT and card fees
- Determines net credits available for sessions
- Creates audit log entry for transparency

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Existing `total_amount` fields maintained
- Migration scripts handle data conversion
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### 4. Real-time UI Updates
- Fee calculations displayed instantly as amounts are entered
- Visual breakdown of gross, VAT, card fee, and net amounts
- Clear indication of available sessions based on net amount

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Fee calculations are deterministic and cacheable
- Package summaries cached to reduce database queries
- Audit logs written asynchronously where possible

### 2. Database Optimization
- Indexed fee-related columns for faster queries
- Optimized migration scripts for large datasets
- Efficient batch processing for data migration

### 3. UI Responsiveness
- Client-side calculations for immediate feedback
- Debounced input handling for smooth UX
- Progressive loading for payment history

## Testing Coverage
