# Feature Changelog

## 2025-06-14: PDF Report Generation & HTMX Navigation Pattern Standardization

### PDF Report Generation Implementation

#### Summary
Enabled PDF generation for fitness assessment reports by fixing the integration between the assessments and reports apps. The feature was already implemented in the reports app but was blocked by a conflicting URL pattern.

### Key Changes
- **Removed Conflicting Route**: Deleted redundant URL pattern and view in assessments app
- **Fixed Field Mappings**: Updated report service to use correct Assessment model fields
- **Updated Score References**: Fixed template variables to match service output
- **Date Field Corrections**: Changed from non-existent `assessment_date` to `created_at`

### Technical Details
- **Infrastructure**: WeasyPrint 63.1 with Korean font support already configured
- **Report Service**: Complete `ReportGenerator` class with PDF generation logic
- **Templates**: Professional HTML template with score visualizations
- **File Storage**: Reports saved to `media/reports/` with proper naming

### Files Modified
- `apps/assessments/urls.py` - Removed conflicting route
- `apps/assessments/views.py` - Removed redundant view function
- `apps/reports/services.py` - Fixed field mappings and score calculations
- `templates/reports/assessment_report.html` - Updated template variables

### Impact
- PDF reports now fully functional from assessment detail page
- Korean text rendering working correctly
- Reports include all assessment data, scores, and recommendations
- File size: ~35KB per report

### HTMX Navigation Pattern Standardization

#### Summary
Standardized HTMX navigation handling across the application to fix duplicate header/footer issues. Created a comprehensive pattern for proper HTMX navigation that prevents nested layouts while maintaining performance benefits.

#### Problem
- Duplicate headers and footers appeared when navigating via HTMX links
- Views were returning full templates (with base.html) inside the `#main-content` div
- Issue affected multiple views including assessment list and client management pages

#### Solution
- Created content-only templates for HTMX navigation requests
- Updated views to detect navigation requests via `HX-Target: main-content` header
- Implemented consistent pattern across assessment and client views
- Created comprehensive documentation for future implementations

#### Technical Implementation
```python
# Navigation detection pattern
if request.headers.get('HX-Request') and request.headers.get('HX-Target') == 'main-content':
    return render(request, 'template_content.html', context)
return render(request, 'template.html', context)
```

#### Files Created
- `templates/assessments/assessment_list_content.html` - Content-only assessment list
- `templates/clients/client_form_content.html` - Content-only client form
- `templates/clients/client_detail_content.html` - Content-only client detail
- `docs/HTMX_NAVIGATION_PATTERN.md` - Comprehensive pattern documentation

#### Files Modified
- `apps/assessments/views.py` - Added HTMX navigation detection
- `apps/clients/views.py` - Updated add, edit, and detail views
- `templates/assessments/assessment_list_partial.html` - Fixed URL pattern

#### Impact
- Eliminated duplicate header/footer issues
- Consistent user experience across all navigation methods
- Preserved HTMX performance benefits for partial updates
- Established pattern for future view implementations

## VAT and Card Processing Fee Implementation

## Summary

This feature introduces automatic VAT (부가세) and card processing fee (카드 수수료) calculations to the fitness assessment system's session package management. The implementation provides transparent financial breakdowns, helping trainers understand the actual net amount after deducting the standard 10% VAT and 3.5% card processing fees from gross payments.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Fee Calculation
- **VAT Rate**: Fixed at 10% (Korean standard)
- **Card Processing Fee**: Fixed at 3.5%

- **Formula**:
  - VAT Amount = Gross Amount × (0.10 ÷ 1.10)
  - Card Fee = Gross Amount × 0.035
  - Net Amount = Gross Amount - VAT Amount - Card Fee

### 2. Enhanced UI Components
- Real-time fee calculation display during package creation
- Detailed fee breakdown in package management view
- Payment history with comprehensive fee information
- Visual indicators for gross amount, fees, and net credits

### 3. Database Enhancements
