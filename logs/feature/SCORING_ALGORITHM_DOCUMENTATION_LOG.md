# Scoring Algorithm Documentation Log

**Date**: 2025-06-13  
**Author**: Claude  
**Feature**: Assessment Scoring Algorithm Documentation

## Summary

Created comprehensive documentation for The5HC fitness assessment scoring algorithms to help validate calculation accuracy and assessment criteria.

## Files Created

### 1. `/docs/ASSESSMENT_SCORING_ALGORITHMS.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete technical documentation of all scoring algorithms
- **Content**:
  - Individual test scoring criteria and thresholds
  - Category score calculation formulas
  - Overall score weighted average calculation
  - Score interpretation guidelines
  - Technical implementation notes
- **Size**: ~400 lines of detailed documentation

### 2. `/docs/SCORING_VALIDATION_EXAMPLES.md`
- **Purpose**: Concrete examples for validating scoring accuracy
- **Content**:
  - Two complete scoring examples with step-by-step calculations
  - Validation checklist for each test type
  - Common scoring patterns and distributions
  - Red flags and improvement guidelines
- **Size**: ~250 lines with detailed examples

## Key Findings from Documentation

### 1. Scoring Scales
- **Individual Tests**: Score 1-4 (except FMS tests: 0-3)
- **Category Scores**: 0-100 points
- **Overall Score**: 0-100 points

### 2. Test-Specific Insights

#### Push-up Test
- Only test with both age and gender adjustments
- Thresholds decrease significantly with age
- Male thresholds ~20% higher than female

#### Harvard Step Test
- Most strict scoring - majority score 1
- PFI ≥90 is elite athlete level
- Average person PFI: 50-70

#### FMS Tests (Overhead Squat, Shoulder Mobility)
- Use 0-3 scale, normalized to 1-4 for calculations
- Focus on movement quality, not quantity
- Score 0 indicates pain (red flag)

#### Balance Test
- Eyes closed weighted 60% (more challenging)
- Returns float score for precision
- Most people score well eyes open, poorly eyes closed

### 3. Category Weights
- **Strength**: 30% (highest - fundamental for daily activities)
- **Mobility**: 25% (injury prevention focus)
- **Balance**: 25% (fall prevention focus)
- **Cardio**: 20% (lowest but still important)

### 4. Score Interpretation
- **90-100**: Very Excellent (elite fitness)
- **80-89**: Excellent (high fitness)
- **70-79**: Average (moderate fitness)
- **60-69**: Needs Attention (below average)
- **<60**: Needs Improvement (significant deficits)

## Validation Findings

### Calculation Accuracy
All scoring formulas documented match the implementation in `scoring.py`:
- ✅ Individual test scoring thresholds correct
- ✅ Normalization formulas accurate
- ✅ Category weight calculations verified
- ✅ Overall score weighted average correct

### Common Patterns
1. Most clients score 50-70 overall (sedentary adults)
2. Harvard Step Test typically yields score 1-2
3. Large category imbalances (>30 points) indicate injury risk
4. Cardio often the weakest category

## Recommendations

### For Trainers
1. Use overall score <50 as medical clearance indicator
2. Focus training on categories scoring <40
3. Re-assess every 4-8 weeks for progress tracking
4. Consider age when interpreting push-up scores

### For System Improvement
1. Consider adding more age-adjusted tests
2. Harvard Step Test scoring may be too strict
3. Add percentile rankings for better context
4. Include injury risk indicators based on imbalances

## Technical Notes

### Data Validation
- All inputs clamped to valid ranges
- Missing data defaults to score 1
- Negative values handled appropriately
- Korean language support included

### Edge Cases Handled
- Invalid gender defaults to Male thresholds
- Age out of range uses closest bracket
- Zero/negative times converted appropriately
- FMS pain score (0) properly handled

## Impact

This documentation provides:
1. **Transparency**: Clear understanding of all scoring logic
2. **Validation**: Ability to manually verify calculations
3. **Training**: Guide for trainers to interpret results
4. **Quality Assurance**: Baseline for testing accuracy
5. **Improvement Path**: Clear indicators for client progress

## Next Steps

1. Review documentation with fitness experts
2. Consider adjusting overly strict thresholds
3. Add visual charts/graphs for easier interpretation
4. Create client-facing simplified version
5. Implement automated validation tests based on examples
