# Timer Implementation Phase 1 - Single Leg Balance

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Phase**: 1 of 4
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary

Implemented precision timer functionality for Single Leg Balance test with Alpine.js components, integrating seamlessly with existing Django forms.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Timer Component Architecture

Created reusable Alpine.js timer component (`balanceTimer`) with following features:
- Precision timing using `performance.now()` (0.1 second accuracy)
- Auto-stop at 60 seconds maximum
- Real-time progress bar visualization
- Form field auto-update on stop
- Haptic feedback support for mobile

### 2. Files Created

#### `/static/js/components/assessment-timers.js`
- Core timer components for all assessment timers
- `balanceTimer` - Single Leg Balance timer
- `farmersCarryTimer` - Farmer's Carry timer (ready for Phase 2)
- `harvardStepTimer` - Harvard Step Test timer (ready for Phase 3)

#### `/static/css/timers.css`
- Comprehensive timer styling with Tailwind utilities
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Accessibility features (high contrast support)
- Dark mode support
- Smooth animations and transitions

#### `/templates/assessments/timer_test.html`
- Demo page for testing timer functionality
- Shows all timer features in action

### 3. Files Modified

#### `/templates/base.html`
- Added timer CSS link
- Added assessment-timers.js script

#### `/templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html`
- Integrated timers into Single Leg Balance section
- Added 4 timer instances:
  - Right leg, eyes open
  - Left leg, eyes open
  - Right leg, eyes closed
  - Left leg, eyes closed

### 4. Key Features Implemented

1. **Precision Timing**
   - Uses `performance.now()` for millisecond accuracy
   - Updates every 100ms for smooth display
   - Formats to 0.1 second precision

2. **User Interface**
   - Large, clear timer display
   - Start/Stop toggle button with icons
   - Reset button to clear timer
   - Visual progress bar (0-60 seconds)
   - Color-coded progress (red → yellow → green)

3. **Form Integration**
   - Automatically updates Django form fields on stop
   - Preserves existing form values on page load
   - Triggers Alpine.js reactivity for score calculations

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Large touch targets
   - Haptic feedback on start/stop
   - Responsive layout adjustments

5. **Accessibility**
   - High contrast mode support
   - Clear visual indicators
   - Keyboard accessible controls

## Technical Decisions

1. **Alpine.js over React/Vue**
   - Maintains consistency with existing codebase
   - No build step required
   - Lightweight and performant

2. **performance.now() over Date.now()**
   - More accurate for short durations
   - Not affected by system clock changes
   - Better for precision timing

3. **Progress Bar Implementation**
   - CSS-based for smooth animations
   - Color changes based on percentage
   - No JavaScript animation loops

## Testing Performed

1. Timer accuracy verified with stopwatch
2. Auto-stop at 60 seconds confirmed
3. Form field updates tested
4. Mobile responsiveness verified
5. HTMX navigation compatibility checked

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Farmer's Carry)
- Implement Farmer's Carry timer
- Add weight input integration
- Calculate weight percentage

### Phase 3: Harvard Step Test
- Complex multi-phase timer
- Metronome implementation (96 BPM)
- Heart rate measurement windows
- Auto PFI calculation

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance optimization
- State persistence across navigation

## Usage Instructions

The timers are now integrated into the assessment form. To use:

1. Navigate to "새 평가 등록" (Add Assessment)
2. Go to Step 3 "균형 및 협응성"
3. Scroll to "외발 서기 테스트" section
4. Click "시작" to start any timer
5. Click "정지" when balance is lost or test complete
6. Timer value automatically saves to form field

## Notes

- Timers work independently - multiple can run simultaneously
- Maximum 60 seconds enforced with auto-stop
- Form submission works normally with timer values
- No backend changes required - uses existing fields
