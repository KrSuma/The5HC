# MCQ Implementation Phase 1: Database Schema Design

**Date**: 2025-06-19
**Author**: Claude
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Database Schema Design

## Summary

Successfully implemented the database schema for the Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) system. Created four new models and added MCQ score fields to the Assessment model to support knowledge, lifestyle, and readiness evaluations.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Created New Models in `apps/assessments/models.py`

#### QuestionCategory Model
- Stores categories for questions (Knowledge, Lifestyle, Readiness)
- Fields include:
  - `name` and `name_ko` for bilingual support
  - `weight` for scoring contribution (0.0-1.0)
  - `order` for display sequencing
  - `is_active` for enabling/disabling categories
  - Timestamps for tracking changes

#### MultipleChoiceQuestion Model
- Stores individual questions within categories
- Supports three question types: single choice, multiple choice, scale/rating
- Features:
  - Bilingual question text and help text
  - Points system for scoring
  - Conditional questions (depends_on, depends_on_answer)
  - Display ordering within categories
  - Active/inactive status

#### QuestionChoice Model
- Stores answer options for each question
- Features:
  - Bilingual choice text
  - Points awarded for selection
  - Risk factor contribution (similar to physical assessments)
  - Correct answer tracking for knowledge questions
  - Display ordering

#### QuestionResponse Model
- Links assessments to MCQ responses
- Features:
  - Many-to-many relationship with choices
  - Automatic point calculation
  - Optional text responses for follow-ups
  - Unique constraint per assessment/question

### 2. Updated Assessment Model

Added four new fields for MCQ scoring:
- `knowledge_score` (0-100)
- `lifestyle_score` (0-100)
- `readiness_score` (0-100)
- `comprehensive_score` (0-100) - Combined physical and MCQ score

### 3. Database Migration

- Created migration: `0010_questioncategory_assessment_comprehensive_score_and_more.py`
- Successfully applied migration to database
- All tables created with proper relationships and constraints

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Relationships
```
QuestionCategory (1) --> (N) MultipleChoiceQuestion
MultipleChoiceQuestion (1) --> (N) QuestionChoice
Assessment (1) --> (N) QuestionResponse
QuestionResponse (N) <--> (N) QuestionChoice
MultipleChoiceQuestion (self-referential) for conditional questions
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Bilingual Support**: All text fields have Korean translations
2. **Flexible Scoring**: Points system with configurable weights
3. **Risk Integration**: Choices can contribute to injury risk assessment
4. **Conditional Logic**: Questions can depend on other question answers
5. **Validation**: Score fields limited to 0-100 range

### Database Indexes
- Unique constraint on QuestionCategory.name
- Composite unique constraint on (assessment, question) for responses
- Ordering indexes for efficient querying

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified
- `/apps/assessments/models.py` - Added MCQ models and Assessment fields

### Created
- `/apps/assessments/migrations/0010_questioncategory_assessment_comprehensive_score_and_more.py` - Migration file
- `/logs/feature/MCQ_PHASE1_DATABASE_SCHEMA_LOG.md` - This log file

## Testing Performed

- Migration created without errors
- Migration applied successfully
- Model relationships validated
- Field constraints properly set

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is now complete. Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 2: Scoring System Integration
- Create MCQScoringEngine class
- Integrate MCQ scores with existing physical assessment scoring
- Implement weighted score calculations

## Notes

- The WeasyPrint warning during migration is unrelated and doesn't affect database operations
- All models follow Django best practices and existing project conventions
- Database schema is designed for future extensibility
