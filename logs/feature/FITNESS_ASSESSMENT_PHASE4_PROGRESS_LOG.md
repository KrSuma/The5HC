# Fitness Assessment Enhancement - Phase 4: Test Variations Support (IN PROGRESS)

**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Author**: Claude  
**Phase**: Phase 4 of 5 - Test Variations Support  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS (5/8 sub-tasks complete)

## Summary
Phase 4 is adding support for different test conditions and variations to ensure accurate scoring regardless of how tests are performed. This includes handling modified push-ups, tracking body weight percentages for farmer's carry, and adjusting scores based on environmental conditions.

## Completed Sub-tasks (5/8)

### 4.1 Add test variation fields ✅
Added four new fields to the Assessment model:
- `push_up_type`: CharField with choices ('standard', 'modified', 'wall')
- `farmer_carry_percentage`: FloatField (0-200%) for body weight percentage
- `test_environment`: CharField with choices ('indoor', 'outdoor')
- `temperature`: FloatField (-10°C to 50°C) for ambient temperature

All fields are optional (null=True, blank=True) to maintain backward compatibility.

### 4.2 Update scoring functions to handle test variations ✅
Modified scoring functions in `scoring.py`:

1. **Push-up Scoring Adjustments**:
   - Modified push-ups: 70% of standard score
   - Wall push-ups: 50% of standard score
   - Updated `calculate_pushup_score()` to accept `push_up_type` parameter

2. **Farmer's Carry Body Weight Normalization**:
   - Standard is 50% body weight for males, 40% for females
   - Score adjusted based on actual percentage used
   - Updated `calculate_farmers_carry_score()` to accept `body_weight_percentage`

3. **Temperature Adjustments**:
   - Created `apply_temperature_adjustment()` function
   - Optimal range: 15-25°C (no adjustment)
   - Max 10% bonus for extreme conditions (<5°C or >35°C)
   - Applied to overall, strength, and cardio scores

### 4.3 Create migration for test variation fields ✅
- Generated migration `0008_add_test_variation_fields`
- Successfully applied to database
- All fields properly configured with validators and defaults

### 4.4 Update assessment forms with variation options ✅
Updated `AssessmentForm`:
- Added all variation fields to form fields list
- Created appropriate widgets with Alpine.js integration:
  - `test_environment`: Select with dynamic temperature field visibility
  - `temperature`: Number input shown only for outdoor tests
  - `push_up_type`: Select that triggers score recalculation
  - `farmer_carry_percentage`: Number input for body weight percentage

### 4.5 Update templates to show test variations ✅
1. **Assessment Form Template**:
   - Added test environment and temperature to basic info step
   - Added push-up type selection to push-up test
   - Added body weight percentage to farmer's carry
   - Updated Alpine.js data to include variation fields

2. **Assessment Detail Template**:
   - Added "Test Conditions" box for non-standard variations
   - Shows push-up type inline with test results
   - Displays farmer carry body weight percentage
   - All variations shown with Korean labels

## Remaining Sub-tasks (3/8)

### 4.6 Write tests for variation scoring adjustments
- Test push-up type adjustments
- Test farmer carry percentage normalization
- Test temperature adjustments
- Test backward compatibility

### 4.7 Update API to support test variations
- Add variation fields to API serializers
- Update API views to handle variations
- Test API endpoints with variations

### 4.8 Create documentation for test variation guidelines
- Document when to use each push-up variation
- Guidelines for body weight percentage selection
- Environmental testing considerations
- Trainer guidance for test selection

## Technical Details

### Scoring Adjustments
- Push-up variations use multiplication factors (0.5, 0.7, 1.0)
- Farmer carry uses body weight percentage normalization
- Temperature adjustments use linear scaling with caps
- All adjustments maintain 1-5 score range

### UI/UX Considerations
- Temperature field only shown for outdoor tests
- All variation fields are optional
- Clear Korean labels for all options
- Visual indicators for non-standard conditions

### Database Impact
- Four new nullable fields added
- No data migration needed
- Full backward compatibility maintained

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining test implementation (sub-task 4.6)
2. Update API endpoints (sub-task 4.7)
3. Create comprehensive documentation (sub-task 4.8)
4. Consider adding more test variations in Phase 5

## Notes
- System designed for easy addition of new variations
- All scoring adjustments are transparent to users
- Korean UI fully integrated throughout
- Ready for production use after remaining tasks
