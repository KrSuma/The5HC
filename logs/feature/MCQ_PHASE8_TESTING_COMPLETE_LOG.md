## Test Examples

### Model Testing Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.django_db
class TestQuestionCategory:
    """Test cases for QuestionCategory model."""
    
    def test_create_category(self):
        """Test creating a question category."""
        category = QuestionCategoryFactory(
            name="Knowledge Assessment",
            name_ko="지식 평가",
            weight=Decimal('0.15')
        )
        
        assert category.name == "Knowledge Assessment"
        assert category.name_ko == "지식 평가"
        assert category.weight == Decimal('0.15')
        assert category.is_active is True
```

### Scoring Engine Testing
```python
def test_calculate_comprehensive_score(self):
    """Test comprehensive score calculation."""
    assessment = AssessmentFactory(overall_score=80.0)
    
    # Create categories with specific scores
    knowledge_cat = QuestionCategoryFactory(name="Knowledge", weight=Decimal('0.15'))
    # ... create questions and responses
    
    engine = MCQScoringEngine(assessment)
    scores = engine.calculate_mcq_scores()
    
    # Verify comprehensive score calculation
    # Physical: 80 * 0.60 = 48
    # Knowledge: 90 * 0.15 = 13.5
    # Total: 48 + 13.5 = 61.5
    assert scores['comprehensive_score'] == pytest.approx(61.5, rel=0.01)
```

### API Testing Pattern
```python
def test_create_single_choice_response(self):
    """Test creating a single choice response via API."""
    url = reverse('api:questionresponse-list')
    data = {
        'assessment': self.assessment.pk,
        'question': self.question1.pk,
        'selected_choices': [self.choice1.pk],
        'response_text': ''
    }
    
    response = self.client.post(url, data, format='json')
    
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED
    assert response.json()['points_earned'] == 10
```

### Integration Testing Pattern
```python
def test_complete_mcq_assessment_workflow(self):
    """Test complete MCQ assessment from start to finish."""
    # 1. Start MCQ assessment
    mcq_url = reverse('assessments:mcq_assessment', kwargs={
        'assessment_id': self.assessment.id
    })
    response = self.client.get(mcq_url)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # 2. Submit MCQ responses
    form_data = {
        f'question_{self.k_q1.id}': self.k_q1_c1.id,
        f'question_{self.l_q1.id}': self.l_q1_c1.id,
    }
    response = self.client.post(mcq_url, form_data)
    assert response.status_code == 302
    
    # 3. Verify scores were calculated
    self.assessment.refresh_from_db()
    assert self.assessment.knowledge_score == 80.0
    assert self.assessment.comprehensive_score is not None
```
