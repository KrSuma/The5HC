**File**: `apps/assessments/models.py`

Added four new fields to the Assessment model:
- `overhead_squat_arm_drop` - BooleanField for arm forward drop
- `overhead_squat_quality` - CharField with choices for performance quality
- `toe_touch_flexibility` - CharField with choices for flexibility levels
- `shoulder_mobility_category` - CharField with choices for distance categories

### 2. Database Migration (COMPLETED)
Created and applied migration:
```bash
./venv/bin/python manage.py makemigrations assessments -n add_movement_quality_details
./venv/bin/python manage.py migrate
```
- Migration file: `0011_add_movement_quality_details.py`
- All fields successfully added to database

### 3. Form Updates (COMPLETED)
**File**: `apps/assessments/forms/assessment_forms.py`

- Added all new fields to the fields list
- Created widgets with proper Alpine.js bindings:
  - `overhead_squat_arm_drop` - CheckboxInput with x-model
  - `overhead_squat_quality` - Select with @change handler
  - `toe_touch_flexibility` - Select with @change handler
  - `shoulder_mobility_category` - Select with x-model

### 4. Template Updates (COMPLETED)
**File**: `templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html`

Added UI elements in appropriate sections:
- Overhead Squat section: Added arm drop checkbox and quality dropdown
- Toe Touch section: Added flexibility level dropdown
- Shoulder Mobility section: Added distance category dropdown

### 5. JavaScript Updates (COMPLETED)
**File**: `templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html` (Alpine.js section)

- Added new Alpine.js data properties
- Enhanced `calculateOverheadSquatScore()` to include arm drop and quality
- Added new `updateToeTouchScore()` method for flexibility-based scoring

## New Field Details

### Overhead Squat Enhancements
1. **Arm Drop Checkbox**: "팔 전방 하강"
2. **Performance Quality Options**:
   - '동작 중 통증 발생' (Pain during movement)
   - '깊은 스쿼트 수행 불가능' (Cannot perform deep squat)
   - '보상 동작 관찰됨' (Compensations observed)
   - '완벽한 동작' (Perfect execution)

### Toe Touch Enhancement
**Flexibility Levels**:
- '손끝이 발에 닿지 않음' (Fingertips don't reach feet)
- '손끝이 발에 닿음' (Fingertips touch feet)
- '손바닥이 발등을 덮음' (Palms cover top of feet)
- '손바닥이 발에 완전히 닿음' (Palms fully touch feet)

### Shoulder Mobility Enhancement
**Distance Categories**:
- '동작 중 통증' (Pain during movement)
- '손 간 거리가 신장 1.5배 이상' (Hand distance > 1.5x height)
- '손 간 거리가 신장 1~1.5배' (Hand distance 1-1.5x height)
- '손 간 거리가 신장 1배 미만' (Hand distance < 1x height)

## Testing

Created test file: `apps/assessments/test_movement_quality_enhancements.py`
- Verified form includes all new fields
- All fields are optional (null=True, blank=True)
- Won't break existing assessments

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Update Risk Calculator**: Integrate new fields into injury risk scoring
2. **Update Admin Interface**: Add fields to Django admin
3. **Update API Serializers**: Include fields in API responses
4. **Update PDF Reports**: Show new assessment data in reports
5. **Create comprehensive tests**: Add integration tests

## Important Notes

- All new fields are **optional** - existing assessments continue to work
- Enhanced scoring logic automatically adjusts based on quality assessment
- JavaScript dynamically updates scores when trainers select options
- Mobile-friendly UI with proper spacing and labels

## Files Modified

1. `/apps/assessments/models.py` - Added 4 new fields
2. `/apps/assessments/migrations/0011_add_movement_quality_details.py` - Database migration
3. `/apps/assessments/forms/assessment_forms.py` - Form fields and widgets
4. `/templates/assessments/assessment_form_content.html` - UI and JavaScript
5. `/apps/assessments/test_movement_quality_enhancements.py` - Test file

## Status: COMPLETE

The movement quality assessment enhancements have been successfully implemented and are ready for use. Trainers can now document more detailed movement quality observations during assessments.
