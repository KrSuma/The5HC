**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Author**: Claude
**Purpose**: Add testing infrastructure migration to Phase 5 planning

## Summary

Added testing infrastructure migration from Django TestCase to pytest as the highest priority task for Phase 5, based on the django-test.md guidelines analysis.

## Todo Items Added

### Main Task
- **ID: 5** - Migrate testing infrastructure from Django TestCase to pytest (High Priority)

### Sub-tasks
1. **ID: 5.1** - Install pytest and related testing packages
2. **ID: 5.2** - Create pytest configuration and test settings
3. **ID: 5.3** - Create factory classes for all models
4. **ID: 5.4** - Convert existing tests to pytest style
5. **ID: 5.5** - Set up CI/CD pipeline for pytest (Medium Priority)
6. **ID: 5.6** - Create testing documentation and train team (Medium Priority)

## Documents Updated

### 1. PHASE5_PREPARATION.md
- Added testing infrastructure as Priority 1 objective
- Updated timeline to include testing migration in Week 1
- Added pytest dependencies to requirements
- Adjusted other tasks to Weeks 2-5

### 2. Created Supporting Documents
- `TESTING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive migration plan
- `test_views_pytest_example.py` - Example conversion
- `factories_example.py` - Factory implementation example
- `PYTEST_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Team reference guide

## Rationale

The testing infrastructure migration was prioritized because:
1. Current tests don't follow django-test.md guidelines
2. pytest provides better features and cleaner syntax
3. Factory pattern improves test data management
4. Foundation for all future development work
5. Better CI/CD integration possibilities

## Next Actions

1. Review and approve the testing migration plan
2. Install pytest packages in virtual environment
3. Create pytest.ini configuration
4. Start with accounts app as pilot conversion
5. Track progress using the todo list sub-tasks
