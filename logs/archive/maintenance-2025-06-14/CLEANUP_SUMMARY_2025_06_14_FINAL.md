## Summary

Performed comprehensive cleanup of project logs and updated CLAUDE.md to reflect current project state.

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. ✅ Consolidated Maintenance Logs
- **Action**: Merged 17 individual session logs into single comprehensive file
- **Created**: `/logs/maintenance/CONSOLIDATED_MAINTENANCE_LOG_2025_06_14.md`
- **Deleted**: 13 individual session files (DAILY_SUMMARY, CLEANUP_SUMMARY, MAINTENANCE_SUMMARY files)
- **Result**: Single 300+ line comprehensive log capturing entire day's work

### 2. ✅ Consolidated Trainers App Implementation Logs  
- **Action**: Merged 5 phase logs into single implementation summary
- **Created**: `/logs/feature/TRAINERS_APP_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_LOG.md`
- **Deleted**: TRAINERS_APP_PHASE1-5 individual logs
- **Result**: Single 400+ line complete implementation reference

### 3. ✅ Consolidated Assessment Score Calculation Logs
- **Action**: Verified existing complete summary contained all phase information
- **Kept**: `/logs/feature/ASSESSMENT_SCORE_CALCULATION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`
- **Deleted**: 5 individual phase logs (PHASE1-5)
- **Result**: Single comprehensive reference for the feature

### 4. ✅ Removed Empty Directory
- **Deleted**: `/apps/assessments/management/commands/__pycache__/` (empty)

### 5. ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md
- **Updated Phase 5 status**: Added completion of model tests (20 tests, 100% pass)
- **Updated file counts**:
  - Django Application: 145+ files (was 140+)
  - Templates: 75+ files (was 70+)
  - Tests: 75+ files (was 70+)
  - Logs: 70+ files (was 85+ before consolidation)
- **Added new key documentation** references to consolidated logs

## Impact

### Before Cleanup
- `/logs/maintenance/`: 19 files (many redundant)
- `/logs/feature/`: 15 files (with duplicate phase logs)
- Total log files: 85+

### After Cleanup
- `/logs/maintenance/`: 6 files (consolidated)
- `/logs/feature/`: 7 files (consolidated)
- Total log files: 70+ (15 files removed through consolidation)

### Benefits
1. **Improved Organization**: Related logs consolidated into comprehensive summaries
2. **Reduced Clutter**: 15 redundant files removed
3. **Better Navigation**: Easier to find information in consolidated logs
4. **Updated Documentation**: CLAUDE.md reflects current project state
5. **Preserved Information**: All important details retained in consolidated files

## No Action Taken On

1. **__pycache__ directories**: Kept as per project conventions
2. **Django log files**: Left for potential debugging needs
3. **Archive directory**: Already organized from previous cleanup
4. **Scripts organization**: Left as-is (minor improvement opportunity)

## Project State

The project is well-maintained with:
- Clean, organized directory structure
- Comprehensive consolidated logs
- Updated documentation
- No temporary files or significant clutter
- All Phase 1-5 work for Trainers App properly documented

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Trainers App Phase 5 remaining tasks:
   - 5.2 Write tests for trainer views and permissions
   - 5.3 Test organization data isolation
   - 5.4 Document multi-tenant architecture
   - 5.5 Create trainer app user guide

2. Consider implementing log rotation for active log files
3. Set up automated cleanup scripts if log volume increases
