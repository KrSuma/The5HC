## Important Decisions and Discoveries

### Technical Decisions

1. **Foreign Key Migration Strategy**
   - Django doesn't easily support changing FK types
   - Created dual strategy: clean for dev, gradual for production
   - Documented in TRAINER_MIGRATION_PLAN.md

2. **HTMX Navigation Pattern**
   - Standardized approach for preventing duplicate headers
   - Content-only templates for partial updates
   - Comprehensive documentation created

3. **Permission Architecture**
   - Middleware-based context injection
   - Decorator-based access control
   - Organization-level data boundaries

### Discoveries

1. **Heroku Configuration**
   - Now uses `.python-version` instead of `runtime.txt`
   - Important for deployment configuration

2. **PDF Generation**
   - Was 95% implemented, just needed conflict resolution
   - WeasyPrint warnings are cosmetic, don't affect functionality

3. **Project Organization**
   - Excellent maintenance practices already in place
   - No significant cleanup needed despite extensive development
