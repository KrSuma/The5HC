# Migration Log - Notification and AuditLog Models

**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Type**: Database Migration  
**Models**: Notification, AuditLog

## Summary

Successfully created and applied migrations for the Notification and AuditLog models that were added during Trainers App Phase 3-4 implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Import Fix
- Updated `/apps/trainers/models.py` to import AuditLog and Notification models
- Fixed missing import in `/apps/trainers/views.py` for `organization_owner_required` decorator

### 2. Migration Created
- File: `apps/trainers/migrations/0004_auditlog_notification_and_more.py`
- Created tables for:
  - `trainers_auditlog` - Audit logging system
  - `trainers_notification` - In-app notification system

### 3. Database Changes

#### AuditLog Table
- Tracks all important actions in the system
- Fields: user, organization, action, content_type, object_id, ip_address, user_agent, extra_data, created_at
- Indexes on: created_at, user+created_at, organization+created_at, action+created_at

#### Notification Table  
- In-app notification system for trainers
- Fields: user, notification_type, title, message, related_object_type, related_object_id, action_url, is_read, read_at, created_at
- Indexes on: user+created_at, user+is_read

### 4. Migration Status
```
trainers
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_create_initial_trainer_profiles
 [X] 0003_add_trainer_indexes
 [X] 0004_auditlog_notification_and_more
```

## Technical Details

The migration also cleaned up some old indexes that were being removed and recreated with better naming conventions:
- Removed old indexes from organization, trainer, and trainerinvitation tables
- Created new optimized indexes for the new models

## Next Steps

With the migrations complete, we can now proceed with:
1. Testing the notification system functionality
2. Testing the audit logging functionality
3. Beginning Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

## Notes

- The WeasyPrint warning during migration is cosmetic and doesn't affect the migration process
- Both models are now ready for use in the application
- The audit logging is already integrated in authentication and client operations
- The notification system is integrated with client creation events
