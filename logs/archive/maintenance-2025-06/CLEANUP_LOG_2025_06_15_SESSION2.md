# Project Cleanup Log - 2025-06-15 (Session 2)

**Date**: 2025-06-15  
**Author**: Claude  
**Type**: Directory cleanup and maintenance  
**Purpose**: Regular maintenance cleanup after Trainers App completion

## Summary

Performed regular maintenance cleanup focusing on:
1. Archiving old migration JSON reports
2. Verifying git status cleanliness
3. Confirming log file organization
4. Preparing for next development phase

## Actions Taken

### 1. Archived Migration JSON Reports ✅
Moved old migration reports from June 9 to archive:
- `scripts/reports/data_issues_report.json` → `logs/archive/migration-reports/`
- `scripts/reports/email_fixes_changelog.json` → `logs/archive/migration-reports/`
- `scripts/reports/pre_migration_cleanup_log.json` → `logs/archive/migration-reports/`
- `logs/migration/migration_report.json` → `logs/archive/migration-reports/`

### 2. Verified Git Status ✅
- Confirmed 10 deleted files in git status are already archived
- These include old assessment score calculation phase logs and June 14 maintenance logs
- All deletions are intentional and documented in previous cleanup sessions

### 3. Confirmed Log Organization ✅
- Operational logs (`.log` files) are properly gitignored
- Log structure remains well-organized:
  - `/logs/feature/` - Feature implementation logs
  - `/logs/maintenance/` - Maintenance and cleanup logs
  - `/logs/migration/` - Django migration phase logs
  - `/logs/archive/` - Historical logs organized by date/type

### 4. No Additional Cleanup Needed ✅
- Root directory is clean
- All documentation properly organized
- No temporary files found
- Project structure is optimal

## Current Project State

### Active Log Files
- 49 files in `/logs/` (excluding archive)
- Well-organized by category
- Recent logs up-to-date with latest work

### Completed Features
- ✅ Trainers App (Phases 1-5 complete)
- ✅ Assessment Score Calculation
- ✅ PDF Generation
- ✅ HTMX Navigation Patterns
- ✅ Multi-tenant Architecture

### Next Development Phase
- Performance Optimization (from PRD)
- Database query optimization
- Caching implementation
- Frontend performance improvements

## Notes

1. The project has undergone significant cleanup in the past week
2. Current organization is optimal - avoid over-organizing
3. Focus should shift to development rather than further cleanup
4. All historical information preserved in archive directories
