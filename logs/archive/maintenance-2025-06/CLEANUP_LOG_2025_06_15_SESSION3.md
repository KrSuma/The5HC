# Maintenance and Cleanup Log - Session 3
**Date**: 2025-06-15
**Author**: Claude
**Session**: Third maintenance session of the day

## Summary

This session focused on fixing critical bugs in the application and improving the PDF report generation system. Key fixes included resolving client form errors, enabling WeasyPrint locally, and simplifying the report generation process.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client Form Trainer Assignment Error
**Problem**: ValueError when creating/editing clients - "Cannot assign User instance to Client.trainer field"
**Fix**: Updated client views to pass `request.trainer` instead of `request.trainer.user`
**Files**: `apps/clients/views.py`

### 2. WeasyPrint Local Support
**Problem**: WeasyPrint not working locally on macOS due to missing library paths
**Solution**: Created `run_with_weasyprint.sh` script that sets DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
**Files**: Created `run_with_weasyprint.sh`

### 3. Assessment Report Field Error
**Problem**: AttributeError - 'Assessment' object has no attribute 'assessment_date'
**Fix**: Changed to use correct field name `date`
**Files**: `apps/reports/models.py`

### 4. PDF Report Improvements
**Problems**: 
- Summary and detailed reports were identical
- PDF content cut off on right side
- Content not centered on page

**Solutions**:
- Implemented report type differentiation (later removed)
- Fixed CSS for proper A4 page layout with margins
- Changed from fixed width to responsive layout

**Files**: 
- `apps/reports/services.py`
- `templates/reports/assessment_report.html`

### 5. Simplified Report Generation
**Change**: Removed summary report type entirely, now only generates detailed reports
**Benefits**: Simpler UX, one-click PDF generation
**Files**: 
- `apps/reports/views.py`
- `apps/reports/models.py`
- `templates/reports/assessment_report.html`
- Created migration: `0003_remove_summary_report_type.py`

## Key Improvements

1. **WeasyPrint Local Development**: Now works with the provided shell script
2. **One-Click PDF Generation**: Removed intermediate selection page
3. **Proper PDF Layout**: Fixed alignment and margins for A4 printing
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unnecessary conditional logic

## Next Steps

1. Run migration: `python manage.py migrate reports`
2. Test PDF generation with: `./run_with_weasyprint.sh`
3. Consider implementing Performance Optimization (identified in PRDs)

## Testing Instructions

1. Client Management:
   - Add new client - should work without errors
   - Edit existing client - should work without errors

2. PDF Reports:
   - Click "PDF 리포트" on assessment detail
   - Should download immediately without selection page
   - PDF should be properly formatted with no cut-off content

## Notes

- The `generate_report.html` template is preserved but no longer used
- All reports now show full detailed content
- WeasyPrint requires system libraries installed via Homebrew on macOS
