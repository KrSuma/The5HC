## Current Development

### Assessment Score Calculation (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Model field updates complete
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Implemented calculate_scores() method with full scoring integration
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Form and UI updates with real-time score calculation
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Data migration for scores (COMPLETE - All 6 assessments updated)
- **Phase 5**: ✅ Testing and validation (COMPLETE)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Frontend Stack**: HTMX + Alpine.js instead of React/Vue for simplicity
2. **Testing Framework**: pytest instead of Django TestCase for better features
3. **PDF Generation**: WeasyPrint for HTML/CSS support
4. **API Authentication**: JWT tokens for stateless auth
5. **Deployment**: Heroku for easy scaling and management

## Current Tasks

### Completed Recently
- ✅ Production deployment (2025-01-11)
- ✅ Streamlit code removal
- ✅ Django reorganization to root
- ✅ Documentation modularization
- ✅ Assessment score calculation implementation (2025-06-13)
- ✅ pytest configuration fix (2025-06-13)
- ✅ PDF report generation implementation (2025-06-14)
- ✅ HTMX navigation pattern standardization (2025-06-14)
  - Fixed duplicate header/footer issues
  - Created comprehensive documentation

### In Progress
- None - All current development tasks complete

### Known Issues
- **pytest test expectations**: 60% of tests fail due to incorrect expectations about scoring algorithms (not bugs)
- **Fixed**: HTMX duplicate header/footer - Implemented content-only templates for navigation requests (see `docs/HTMX_NAVIGATION_PATTERN.md`)

## Important Documents

### Main Documentation
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Modular AI assistant knowledge base
- `/README.md` - Project setup and overview
- `/docs/kb/` - Modular knowledge base files
- `/docs/api/` - API documentation

### Key Migration Logs
- `/logs/migration/` - Phase completion logs
- `/logs/feature/` - Feature implementation logs
- `/logs/maintenance/` - Cleanup and maintenance logs

## Technical Details

### Production Django App

## Next Steps

### Remaining TODOs
1. **Password Reset Email** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement email sending in `accounts/views.py`
   - Configure email backend settings
   
2. **API Session Package Expiration** (Low Priority)
   - Improve expiration date filtering in API views
   
3. **Trainers App** (Low Priority)
   - Currently just a placeholder
   - Needs full implementation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Short-term**: Complete remaining TODO items
2. **Medium-term**: Mobile app integration
3. **Long-term**: Performance optimization and scaling

## Notes

- Django migration fully complete and in production
