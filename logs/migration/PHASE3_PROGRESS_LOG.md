- Manual compilation script (`compile_messages.py`) for environment independence
- 135+ translation entries covering all major UI components

#### Files Created/Modified
- **New Files**:
  - `/locale/ko/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` - Korean translation source
  - `/locale/ko/LC_MESSAGES/django.mo` - Compiled translation binary
  - `/compile_messages.py` - Manual translation compilation script

## Technical Implementation Details

### HTMX Integration
```html
<!-- Form submission -->
<form hx-post="{% url 'accounts:login' %}"
      hx-target="#login-form-container"
      hx-swap="innerHTML">
```

### Alpine.js Components
```javascript
// Counter animation on dashboard
x-data="{ count: 0, target: {{ value }} }"
x-init="animate counter from 0 to target"
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login form via HTMX
2. Server validates credentials and rate limits
3. Failed attempts increment counter (lock after 5)
4. Success redirects with toast notification
5. Session expires after 24 hours or browser close

## Next Steps

### Testing Coverage (Final Phase 3 Task)
1. Unit tests for forms (authentication, client, session forms)
2. Integration tests for HTMX workflows and user journeys
3. View tests for all CRUD operations and dashboard analytics
4. Authentication and authorization testing
5. Korean localization testing (translation accuracy, formatting)
6. Performance testing for dashboard queries and chart rendering

### Remaining Phase 3 Tasks
- [x] Base templates with HTMX/Alpine.js configuration
- [x] Authentication system (login/logout/session management)
- [x] Client management UI (list/detail/add/edit/delete)
- [x] Assessment forms with multi-step workflow
- [x] Session management interface
