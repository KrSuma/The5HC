  - Fixed sqlite3.Row object attribute access issues
  - Updated field mappings to match Django model fields (session_duration, session_cost)
  - Added proper time parsing for microsecond formats
  - Improved error handling for optional fields

### 2. Data Migration Results
- **Trainers**: 7 records migrated successfully
- **Clients**: 10 records migrated successfully
- **Assessments**: 5 new records created (2 skipped as duplicates)
- **Session Packages**: 5 records migrated successfully
- **Sessions**: 7 records migrated successfully
- **Payments**: 6 records migrated successfully

  - Updated ALLOWED_HOSTS to include development addresses

## Testing

## Next Steps

With both PDF generation and data migration complete, Phase 4 is now finished. The Django application is fully functional with:
- ✅ Complete UI implementation (Phase 3)
- ✅ PDF report generation (Phase 4)
- ✅ Data migration from Streamlit (Phase 4)

Future phases (5-6) could include:
- Production deployment configuration
- Performance optimizations
- API development
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced analytics features

## Notes

- Django database uses SQLite for development (same as Streamlit)
- All relationships and foreign keys properly established
- Timezone-aware datetime handling implemented
- Fee calculation data (VAT, card fees) fully preserved
