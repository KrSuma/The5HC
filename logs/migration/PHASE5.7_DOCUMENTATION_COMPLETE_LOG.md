  - Project testing structure
  - Writing tests (models, views, forms, APIs, HTMX)
  - Factory pattern usage
  - Common testing patterns
  - Running tests with various options
  - Debugging techniques
  - Performance optimization
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 2. Pytest Best Practices (`docs/PYTEST_BEST_PRACTICES.md`)
- **Purpose**: Team guidelines for consistent test writing
- **Contents**:
  - Core principles (independence, fixtures, factories)
  - Naming conventions
  - Test structure (Arrange-Act-Assert, Given-When-Then)
  - Parametrized testing
  - Fixture best practices
  - Performance tips
  - Debugging strategies
  - Common pitfalls and solutions
  - Coverage guidelines

### 3. Test Templates (`docs/TEST_TEMPLATES.md`)
- **Purpose**: Ready-to-use templates for common test scenarios
- **Templates Included**:
  - Model test template
  - View test template (ListView, CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView)
  - Form test template
  - API test template (REST endpoints)
  - HTMX test template
  - Complete feature test example (Session Package)
- **Features**:
  - Copy-paste ready code
  - Placeholder markers for easy customization
  - Korean language considerations
  - Edge case examples

### 4. CI/CD Testing Guide (`docs/CICD_TESTING_GUIDE.md`)
- **Purpose**: Automated testing setup for continuous integration
- **Contents**:
  - GitHub Actions workflows (basic and advanced)
  - GitLab CI/CD configuration
  - Pre-commit hooks setup
  - Docker testing environment
  - Coverage requirements and enforcement
  - Environment configuration
  - Best practices for CI/CD
  - Troubleshooting common issues

## Key Features Documented

### Testing Infrastructure
- pytest configuration with Django integration
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Korean locale support in tests
- Performance optimizations (in-memory DB, fast password hasher)
- Parallel test execution

### Best Practices Established
- Test independence and isolation
- Descriptive naming conventions
- Proper use of fixtures over setUp methods
- Parametrized testing for multiple scenarios
- Mocking external dependencies
- Coverage thresholds (80% target)

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated testing on push/PR
- Matrix testing for multiple Python/Django versions
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Security scanning
- Coverage reporting
- Pre-commit hooks for local testing

## Documentation Integration

### README Updates
- Added Testing section with links to all documentation
- Quick command reference for common operations
- Current coverage status
- Clear navigation to testing guides
