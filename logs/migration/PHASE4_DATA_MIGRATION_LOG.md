# Phase 4 - Data Migration Progress Log

**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Author**: Claude
**Phase**: Phase 4 - Data Migration (phase4-data-2)
**Status**: In Progress

## Summary

Working on implementing the main data migration script from Streamlit to Django. Encountered several technical challenges with Django setup.

## Technical Issues Encountered

### 1. Django Settings Configuration
- Initial database configuration issues resolved by updating `the5hc/settings/base.py`
- Split SQLite and PostgreSQL configurations for clarity

### 2. Translation/i18n Issues
- Korean translation files causing UnicodeDecodeError
- Temporarily disabled i18n by setting:
  - `LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'`
  - `USE_I18N = False`

### 3. WeasyPrint Dependencies
- Missing system libraries for WeasyPrint (libgobject-2.0-0)
- This is blocking Django's full initialization when reports app is loaded

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `/django_migration/scripts/migrate_data_from_streamlit.py` (v2.0)
   - Complete rewrite with better error handling
   - Progress tracking and statistics
   - Atomic transactions for data integrity
   - JSON report generation

2. `/django_migration/scripts/run_data_migration.py`
   - Helper script to run migration

3. `/django_migration/.env`
   - Development environment variables

### Modified
1. `/django_migration/the5hc/settings/base.py`
   - Fixed database configuration
   - Temporarily disabled i18n

## Migration Script Features

The updated migration script includes:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Progress statistics for each model
- ID mapping to maintain relationships
- Support for both create and update operations
- Atomic transactions to ensure data integrity
- JSON migration report generation

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix WeasyPrint Dependencies
Install required system libraries:
```bash
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi glib
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### Option 2: Create Standalone Migration
Create a migration script that bypasses Django's full initialization and works directly with the database.

### Option 3: Temporarily Remove Reports App
Comment out the reports app from INSTALLED_APPS and URLs to run migration, then re-enable after.

## Recommendation

I recommend Option 3 as the quickest path forward:
1. Temporarily disable the reports app
2. Run Django migrations
3. Execute data migration
4. Re-enable reports app
5. Fix WeasyPrint dependencies separately

This approach allows us to complete the data migration without being blocked by PDF generation dependencies.
