# Trainers App Implementation - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview
The Trainers App will transform the currently placeholder Django app into a fully functional module for managing trainer profiles, settings, and multi-trainer organizations. This enhancement will enable The5HC system to support multiple trainers working independently or within the same organization, with proper data isolation and personalized settings.

## Goals
- Enable multi-trainer support with proper data isolation
- Provide comprehensive trainer profile management
- Allow trainers to customize their business settings
- Support organizational hierarchies (owner, staff trainers)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing single-trainer setup

## User Stories
- As a gym owner, I want to add multiple trainers to my organization so that each can manage their own clients independently
- As a trainer, I want to customize my profile information so that clients see my qualifications and specialties
- As a trainer, I want to set my own business hours and availability so that clients can book sessions appropriately
- As an organization owner, I want to manage trainer permissions so that I can control access to sensitive data
- As a trainer, I want to see analytics specific to my clients and sessions so that I can track my performance
- As a trainer, I want to customize session pricing and package options so that I can manage my business independently

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must support trainer profile creation with fields for name, bio, certifications, specialties, and profile photo
2. The system must implement role-based permissions (Owner, Senior Trainer, Trainer, Assistant)
3. The system must isolate client data by trainer (clients belong to specific trainers)
4. The system must allow trainers to set custom business hours and availability schedules
5. The system must support trainer-specific session pricing and package configurations
6. The system must provide trainer-specific analytics dashboards
7. The system must allow organization owners to invite and manage other trainers
8. The system must maintain audit trails for multi-trainer organizations
9. The system must support trainer deactivation without data loss
10. The system must allow trainers to transfer clients between trainers within an organization

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Payment processing between organization and trainers
- Trainer scheduling/calendar synchronization with external services
- Client-trainer messaging system
- Trainer performance reviews or rating systems
- Automated commission calculations

## Design Considerations
- Extend the existing navigation to include a "Trainers" section for organization owners
- Add trainer selection dropdown in the main navigation for quick switching
- Use consistent UI patterns from existing client and assessment management pages
- Implement lazy loading for trainer lists in large organizations
- Add trainer profile photos using existing media handling patterns
- Include trainer information in PDF reports and session summaries

## Technical Considerations
- Modify existing models to include trainer foreign keys where appropriate
- Implement Django model permissions for trainer-based access control
- Update all existing views to filter data by current trainer
- Ensure API endpoints respect trainer-based data isolation
- Add trainer context to all templates requiring personalization
- Consider database indexing on trainer foreign keys for performance
- Implement proper CASCADE/PROTECT rules for trainer deletion

## Success Metrics
- All existing features continue working with trainer-based filtering
- Organization owners can successfully add and manage multiple trainers
- Data isolation is properly enforced (trainers cannot see each other's clients)
- Performance remains acceptable with multiple trainers (page load < 2 seconds)
- Zero data leaks between trainers in the same organization

## Open Questions
- Should trainers be able to share specific clients within an organization?
- What level of customization should trainers have for assessment forms?
- Should there be limits on the number of trainers per organization?
- How should the system handle trainer departures from organizations?
- Should trainer-specific branding be supported (logos, colors)?
