# Performance Optimization - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview
This initiative focuses on optimizing The5HC system's performance to ensure fast response times and efficient resource utilization as the user base grows. The optimization will target database queries, caching strategies, and frontend rendering performance, particularly for data-heavy operations like analytics dashboards and assessment lists.

## Goals
- Reduce average page load time to under 1 second for common operations
- Eliminate N+1 query problems across all views
- Implement strategic caching to reduce database load by 50%
- Optimize Chart.js rendering for smooth performance with large datasets
- Maintain current functionality while improving speed

## User Stories
- As a trainer, I want pages to load quickly so that I can efficiently manage clients during busy periods
- As a trainer with many clients, I want the client list to load instantly so that I can quickly find specific clients
- As a trainer, I want the analytics dashboard to render smoothly even with years of historical data
- As a trainer, I want search operations to be instantaneous so that I don't waste time waiting
- As a system administrator, I want the application to handle multiple concurrent users without degrading performance

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must use select_related() and prefetch_related() to optimize database queries
2. The system must implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data (dashboard stats, client counts)
3. The system must use database query result pagination for large datasets
4. The system must implement lazy loading for charts with large datasets
5. The system must cache compiled translation files in production
6. The system must use database connection pooling for PostgreSQL
7. The system must implement frontend debouncing for search operations
8. The system must compress and minify static assets (CSS, JavaScript)
9. The system must implement database query monitoring in development
10. The system must use asynchronous loading for non-critical dashboard components

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Switching to a different database system
- Implementing a separate caching server infrastructure
- Rewriting existing features for marginal gains
- Implementing custom database query optimization
- Moving to a microservices architecture

## Design Considerations
- Add loading indicators for any operation taking more than 500ms
- Implement skeleton screens for dashboard components while data loads
- Use progressive enhancement for chart rendering (basic first, enhanced later)
- Maintain current UI/UX while improving performance
- Add subtle animations to mask any remaining load times
- Display cached data immediately with refresh indicators

## Technical Considerations
- Use Django Debug Toolbar in development to identify slow queries
- Implement query counting tests to prevent N+1 regression
- Use Django's built-in caching framework with Redis backend
- Configure Gunicorn workers appropriately for production
- Enable PostgreSQL query plan caching
- Use WhiteNoise for efficient static file serving
- Implement database indexing based on query analysis
- Consider using Django-cachalot for ORM-level caching

## Success Metrics
- 90% of pages load in under 1 second
- Database query count reduced by 60% on average
- Zero N+1 queries in production code
- Analytics dashboard renders smoothly with 10,000+ records
- Memory usage remains stable under load
- 95th percentile response time under 2 seconds

## Open Questions
- What is the expected maximum number of concurrent users?
- Should we implement read replicas for database scaling?
- What caching TTL values are acceptable for different data types?
- Should we implement API response caching?
- Are there specific pages users complain about being slow?
